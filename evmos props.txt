This will sponsor gas payments for end users when they perform actions like SWAP, STAKE and more on Diffusion. The only constraint is that these incentives have to be less than the fees. Incentives can be up to 120% the total amount of fees burned, so users can end up being paid to use Diffusion. Beware that users will still have to pay for the fees upfront but will get reimbursed each epoch (1 week by default), so they are accumulated and then reimbursed.",

This is a reasonable misunderstanding as the network query for this param mistakenly returns a value denominated in seconds, i.e. this query: `evmosd query claims params` previously resulted in a response of: `duration_until_decay: 3801600s`.\n\nThis proposal also serves as an early signal, should the community decide to conduct a coordinated upgrade prior to its full voting period.\n\nOriginal discussion of the proposal that led to this issue: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4744-extend-claims-period-by-21-days",

        "description": "## Author\n\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\n\n## Parameter being changed with this proposal\n\nIf successful, this proposal will enable the inflation module on Evmos by changing the `ParamStoreKeyEnableInflation` parameter from `false` to `true`. This propsal has a voting time of 5 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWhen the chain initially launched, the inflation module was enabled and new Evmos tokens were minted and allocated according to the Evmos Token Model once a day until the chain halted. After the halt, Evmos relaunched with the inflation module disabled for two main reasons:\n\n* ensure that the chain is secure and chain upgrades are successful\n* give more time to those who hadn't been able to claim their airdrop\n\n## Impact\n\nNow, that several upgrades have passed successfully on-chain and more users have claimed their airdrop, inflation could be enabled. Enabling this module activates\n\n* staking rewards,\n* usage incentives and\n* community pool allocation.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4965-enable-inflation-module). For an in-depth explanation of the module, please refer to the [module specification](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/inflation/).\n\n## Testing on Testnet\n\nWith [proposal 28](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/28) the inflation module has already been enabled on Testnet. Please take part in testing its correctness by\n\n* staking tokens: You should receive staking rewards once a day\n* interacting with registered usage incentives: You should be able to query your gas meters after interacting with an incentivized smart contract. Once a week, your gas meters are reset and you receive Evmos tokens from the incentives pool based on how much gas you spent on interacting with incentivized smart contracts. The incentives pool fills up once a day through inflation\n* querying the community pool: a part of inflation is allocated in the community pool once a day. Query the community pool to make sure it's increasing according to the [Evmos Token Model](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b).\n\nNote, that the team allocation of the Evmos Token Model is not handled through inflation but instead was implemented with vesting accounts.",

        "description": "Full proposal (on IPFS): https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmf7wwUCzPfBZLcmkv4UkbfVU4xA5SkyjvCxVcpc3jtq5z \n\nPrior commonwealth discussion (draft version): https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/4926-1m-evmos-developer-incentive-program-proposal-from-web3scholarship-program\n\nProposal:\n* Web3Scholarship program, the Web3 funding \u0026 incuabtion vehicle, which is funded by Huobi Incubator and with members including Dorahacks, Dao Maker etc., is proposing a $1m hackathon like developer incentive program on Evmos\n* Web3Scholarhip program is chain agnostic and supporting ecosystem building including Avalanche, Dfinity etc. Web3Scholarship initiate collaborations driven by research, Evmos Included. We’re bullish on Evmos\n* The goal for the hackathon event is to support ecosystem building after launch at a critical market condition. Incentives include $500k grants, over $500k investment, at least $10m liquidity, express IDO/IEO listing and incubation/advisory support to winning teams deployed on Evmos\n* It is proposed to have a 50-50 split of grants between Evmos community \u0026 Web3scholarship and sponsors, where $250k worth of Evmos tokens are asked for as grants to winning teams. Venture funding and liquidity come from Web3scholarship.\n* What we ask from Evmos community: 125,000 Evmos tokens (assuming Evmos price of $2USD according to roughly last 14 day average price). The principle is to provide $250k worth of Evmos tokens, therefore the actual number of tokens distributed may depend on future price performance close to (average 30 day Evmos token price prior) initial prize distribution i.e. the winning team announcement date . If \u003e $2, no more tokens are needed and remaining undistributed tokens stay at Evmos community. If less, then vice versa applies(open to revision).\n* Prize tracks: Grand prize(80k), Defi/Infra/ Web3/Metaverse Track prize (100k*4), EVM Migration prize (20k)\n\n\n\nReasoning and Potential Impact:\n* After Evmos mainnet is live and network is stable, it creates good window for ecosystem building whereas currently there is only Evmos limited grant available for devs. \n* The goal is to incentivize growth of key pillars of DeFi, NFT and Infrastructure of Evmos ecosystem at early stage, and teams of high aptitude will see a tangible leap in terms of performance and adoption via incentives and incubation.\n* Web3Scholarship is diverse \u0026 strong to provide attractive incentives and valuable incubation. The event is likely to get momentum for the ecosystem and ahchieve network effect.\n\n\n\nDeliverables and Timeline:\nThe whole event will firstly take 1 month planning starting from now and 1 and half months for the actual event. Event period is planned to be from July 7 to August 22. During which, Evmos specific developer support such as AMA and tutorials will be offered. \n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n* Goals: It is expected to have over 1,000 developers signed in, over 60 submissions and produce 3-5 investable projects and 1-2 flagships.\n* Avoid rug: strict scrutiny; code review; criteria; penalty clause\n* Quality projects: selective criteria; dev turnout: referrals\n* Dev turnout: galvanizing 10+ communities including Devpost, Dorahacks\n* Community engagement: will utilize hack platform to involve community vote in the selection of winning teams. \n\nProtection clause: Penalty and protection clause to be made so event host \u0026 sponsor are entitled to reject or make conditional fund provision.\n\nDistribution transparency:\nTo ensure a proper and synchronized grant distribution from both Evmos and Web3Scholarship, gnosis safe will be established and used for offering grants.\n\nAt last, features industry wide collaboration \u0026 contribution, we hope to spur growth at this critical point of time by this event. Thanks for your time to read this proposal and we apppreciate your support.",

        "title": "EVMOS GRANT - Airdrop Calculator built by Cryptech",
        "description": "Cryptech is a web3 software development team with experience building an Airdrop Calculator for the Neptune Finance team on the Terra blockchain.\n\nAn Airdrop Calculator is a helpful application and dev tool that makes it easy for project teams to provide individual wallets with an airdrop according to chosen parameters. Without an Airdrop Calculator, it is costly in time and network resources for each team to manually track delegations and design an airdrop algorithm. This saves on dev time and gets airdrops into the hands of the Evmos community faster!\n\nCryptech is proposing to build a calculator web app with features for project teams, data analysts and individuals. The web app allows teams and analysts to choose an airdrop  distribution style (quadratic distribution, time-weight, single snapshot, etc.) and export a json or csv file that illustrates each wallet’s delegations, and the airdrop share they are expecting to receive. Additionally, the app will allow individuals to head to the Airdrop Calculator web page to calculate their delegations and the time spent delegating.\n\nThis app will help project teams save time calculating airdrop shares and help individuals track their delegations. To build this web application and make it available to the Evmos community, the Cryptech team is seeking 19,500 EVMOS tokens (~45k USD based on 14-day price average) to fund the following line items:\n\n- Full-stack web developer\n- Cloud infrastructure engineer\n- UX and graphics design\n- Data logging services and indexing\n- Running a private archival node until a public node is available\n- Web hosting for the application\n\nFor the sake of community confidence, the tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet controlled by community members, where 40% of the allocation to be provided up front to begin work and the remaining 60% to be delivered when MVP is online to continue improvement.\n\nMore details on the proposal and community discussion can be found here: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5178-evmos-grant-airdrop-calculator-built-by-cryptech-developments-ltd",

This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\\n\\n## Motivation\\n\\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\\n\\n## Impact\\n\\nOn a high level, the 'v5.0.0' software includes the following improvements:\\n\\n* ERC20 module: Improve coin denomination display and allow coins with 'erc20/' names to be sent over IBC\\n* Improve congestion issues for EVM transactions on Ethermint through the 'MinGasPrice' and 'MinGasMultiplier' fee market parameters\\n* Add observability for Evmos and Ethermint modules to measure performance\\n* Cosmos SDK and IBC dependency updates\\n\\nSoftware upgrades also allow changing the state or parameters. The following migrations are included in this upgrade:\\n\\n* Update Tendermint Consensus Evidence params to prepare to move to a block time of 2 seconds\\n* Update faulty IBC denomination traces for denominations with 'erc20/'\\n* Resolve Airdrop claims: A few users' tokens are still locked due to issues with the airdrop. By swapping claimed actions we allow the users to migrate the records via IBC if needed or mark the Evm action as completed for the Keplr users who are not able to complete it. Since no actual claiming of action is occurring, the balance will remain unchanged\\n* Migrates the claims record of a specific early contributor (Blockchain at Berkeley) from one address to another. See the [Rektdrop blog post](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) for details about Early Contributors\\n* Set the 'MinGasPrice' param value to '25,000,000,000aevmos' (view [discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5073-global-min-gas-price-value-for-cosmos-sdk-and-evm-transaction-choosing-a-value))\\n* The EVM now only refunds 50% of the leftover gas\\n\\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v5.0.0).\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade is performed and on testnet with [testnet proposal #34](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/34).\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5467-evmos-software-upgrade-v500).",

        "description": "View the discussion and full proposal here: \n\n https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/5320-grant-request-to-sponsor-evmos-public-rpc-by-pocket-network \n\n This proposal is seeking funding to sponsor daaps of the EVMOS community with Pocket Network RPC usage. Developers will be able to mint secure endpoints via https://www.portal.pokt.network/ and benefit from our dev rel support, and endpoint security features. Additionally, we will provide a public-exposed endpoint. ( There is one we are already contributing to at https://evmos-json-rpc.stakely.io/ ).\n\n Pocket Network is a decentralized RPC service that enables a permissionless network of independent node operators to be incentivized for running full nodes for blockchains supported by the network. Daaps pay for RPC throughput by staking POKT token, and node operators are compensated in POKT token based on RPC requests served. The beauty of this model is a positive feedback loop that is created: as the usage of the RPC increases, the incentive payout for node runners also increases, thus incentivizing more full nodes to spin up and strengthening the overall RPC service. \n\n This model reduces central points of failure within the RPC layer, while increasing geographic distribution, redundancy, and censorship resistance.  We currently support over 20 blockchain networks including many popular EVM protocols.  We have recently added support for Evmos EVM mainnet. For real-time network data visit: https://www.poktscan.com/ \n\n By sponsoring daap’s usage of Pocket RPC within the EVMOS community we are contributing to decentralization, increased resiliency, and censorship resistance of the network.",

This means 23k tokens will go towards Frax / FXS pools\n\nFrax has signaled their desire to become a fully collateralized stablecoin native to the Evmos ecosystem. This would help reinforce that, and would unlock many great use-cases for Evmos.\n\nThe funds will be sent to a multi sig with myself and founders of the projects mentioned for a 5 of 7 multi sig with. The members on the multi sig are:\n*myself\n*kinesis\n*cronus\n*coslend\n*exswap\n*diffusion\n*saddle\nThe multisig address is evmos:`0x27319052224B1E0cb6C7250f4BD4EE0e3a76755f`\n\nThe multisig will distribute tokens to project founders in equally split amounts to be allocated as incentives for those that provide liquidity during the program’s duration of 3 months.\n\nThe grants are intended to be as inclusive as possible, while also remaining competitive to projects that have shown strong traction or been very active participants in the Evmos ecosystem. With that said, there will be additional grant proposals like this to consider future projects that were not included in this initial proposal.",

        "description": "Summary:\n\nThis proposal is to fund Evmos external incentives on Osmosis. It requests 600,000 Evmos from the community pool for EVMOS/OSMO Pool 722. The rewards would be distributed over the course of 90 days for 14 day bonding time only. This would amount to 5555.56 per day in external rewards.\n\nThe funds will be managed by a multisig wallet at the address below, and includes the following members:\n\nAddress:\n0xbAFE2Ae09c621462032BbC7FC997aA89c9780639\nevmos1htlz4cyuvg2xyqeth3lun9a238yhsp3emvs8ud\n\n- bennylava - Evmos Community Manager/Evmos Governance Workstream\n- Tricky - Cosmos Spaces / Evmos Governance Workstream\n- LPX - Evmos Governance Workstream\n- JohnnyWyles - Osmosis Labs\n\nWeighted 3/4\n\nGoals\nExternal incentives in Osmosis, [pool 722](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/722) would help deepen Evmos liquidity on Osmosis resulting in lower slippage and stronger TVL. It would also support new user adoption by making the Evmos pool a desirable location to earn yield for Osmosis community members who have not interacted with Evmos yet. Externally rewarded pools in Osmosis boosts OSMO incentives as well. Based on the current high swap returns, Osmosis would be matching these external incentives 1:1 with OSMO rewards See Osmosis [proposal 264](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/264). Lastly, the external incentives will be issued daily in the form of the Evmos token to those bonded in the liquidity pool. This new liquidity will allow Osmosis users to explore the Evmos ecosystem by checking out Evmos EVM applications or help secure the network via staking.\n\nYou can find the community discussion [here](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6040-ideation-osmosis-external-incentives)",

        "description": "**Who We Are:**\n\nI'm Hsin-Ju, founder \u0026 CEO of Dystopia Labs (http://dystopialabs.com). We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota. Since our inception in 2019, we've hosted 449+ workshops and 15 summits with reach in 18+ countries. With over 28,000+ registrants for our events, we've built strong crypto hubs in SF, LA, Austin, Portland, and brought in 345+ speakers from ETH Foundation, 0x, Curve, Aave, Osmosis, Sommelier, \u0026 more. TLDR; we have a strong developer community.\n\n\n**Why Our Proposal Matters:**\n\nSince Evmos is an EVM compatible chain, there's a huge opportunity for us to collaborate together to bring new developers and projects into the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n- Dystopia Labs would like to invite Evmos to speak at our upcoming two events: Hacksummit SF (a 2 day summit right before Stanford Blockchain Conference) and DeFi Bogota (a 1 day summit right before Devcon).\n- We are looking to ask the Evmos team for $15k support per event, totaling to $30k. This will help cover venue costs, AV support, furniture, and food.\n- We expect 300-350 ppl per event. And like always, our events are 100% free to attendees so we'd love to have the Evmos community get involved and attend.\n- To us, a successful event would be oversubscribed, have fantastic speakers, and help bring more awareness and interest in the Evmos ecosystem.\n- In the past, we've had speakers like: Vitalik Buterin, Austin Griffith, the Flashbot's team, Stani Kulechov, the CEO of Aave, the SEC Commissioner, and more. TLDR; you will be in good company at our events.\n- Other sponsors include: UMA, 1inch Exchange, Figment, Rarible, and more.\n\n\n**We're Part Of The Ecosystem:**\n\nOur goal is to build a long-term relationship w/ the Evmos team / ecosystem and be a consistent contributor through events.\n-------------- \nNotes added by governance:\n\n- At the time of writing, Evmos is around $2.15. $30K is roughly 13,954 EVMOS when rounded up.\n- Proposal has gone through the recommended guidelines.

        "description": "This is a long, detailed proposal with markdown tables which may not render properly - **additionally, the proposal exceeded the max length, so a large portion has been excluded.** Please view the proposal on your browser if you wish to view it in its entirety, [on IPFS.](https://bafybeigcppwlvbrm6dwfaphflizaebvbpbkdkwqndlhublgdaq6xiry7py.ipfs.dweb.link/Evmos%20Sponsorship%20of%20HackAtom%202022%20Seoul%20and%20Participation%20in%20Korea%20Blockchain%20Week.html) The original Commonwealth thread can also be viewed [here.](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6083-prevote-draft-evmos-sponsorship-of-hackatom-2022-seoul-and-participation-in-korea-blockchain-week) \n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis proposal will provide the funding necessary needed for the sponsorship of the upcoming HackAtom 2022 event in Seoul which will be held July 29th to 31th, followed by the participation in ETH Seoul and Korea Blockchain Week which ends on 14th of August. The HackAtom hackathon will also kick off the first of many events planned for [discoverEVMOS](https://evmos.builders), a developer onboarding and network growth initiative.\n\n---\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nHackAtom is the largest and most recognized hackathon in the Cosmos ecosystem, organized by the Interchain Foundation with its history dating [back to 2017](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-the-cosmos-hackatom-winners-9fc083098da). A lot has happened since 2017 -- even as the world was momentarily flipped upside down, the Cosmos ecosystem continued to build, and #IBCgang as a whole has achieved countless milestones that the early builders have dreamed of.\n\nEvmos is incredibly special in that it has the best of both worlds - EVM and Cosmos. In fact, Evmos exists today because of [Cosmos Hub Proposal #44](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-44-accepted-advancing-ethermint-gtm-and-engineering-plan-for-the-ethermint-chain/4554)\n\n---\n\n ## **The Event** \n\n**Announcing Cosmos’s HackATOM Seoul**\n\nHackAtom Seoul, Organized by Interchain in collaboration with the talented KryptoSeoul team, will be our first in-person Hackathon since 2019 and the first Cosmos-branded event in the Asian continent since the pandemic began. The full announcement [can be read here](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-cosmoss-hackatom-seoul-b6858b9beac7).\n\n**Participating IBC Frens:**\n\n* Cosmos Hub, Interchain Foundation, Cosmostation, Osmosis, Crescent, Juno, plus more (check announcement).\n\n**Date**: July 29-31\n**Location**: Hanwha Dreamplus, Seoul\n\n---\n\n ## **Community Funding Request** \n\nThe requested amount as it stands is $168K, with the bulk of it going towards hackathon prizes and developer outreach. $50K allocated for marketing and PR will come from the waived sponsorship fee from Interchain Foundation.\n\n **A. Sponsorship Fees**\n\nPlatinum Sponsorship Package (Fee Waived) Includes:\n\n* 1 booth at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* 1 judging seat at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* 1 workshop at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* 10-minute speaker spot at the Welcome Ceremony, Day 1 \n* Co-host at Official Afterparty at HackAtom Seoul 2022 \n* Evmos marketing one-pager included in Welcome Packet \n* HackAtom badges printed with your Evmos under Platinum Sponsor \n* Evmos logo insignia on the marketing video produced during HackAtom Seoul 2022\n\n### **B. Hackathon Prizes**\n\nThe prize amount was selected simply based on the amount that Osmosis and Juno are offering ($100K each). \n\n[Current Hackathon Challenges and Prize Pool](https://bafybeienbj44fytisfpq6a5svc5t32qcxgwjvdkqejfys2degjnhhotbkm.ipfs.dweb.link/tracks.png)\n\nThe final hackathon tracks will be discussed and determined with the core dev team as well as with consultation from evmos4volunteers.\n\n### **C. Marketing and PR Expenses**\n\nThe numbers that I am providing are currently derived as best estimates from my past experiences with sponsoring and hosting events. Past events include Blockshow Vegas 2018, BlockchainNW Seattle 2018, LA Blockchain Week 2018, Global AI Conference in Santa Clara, Consensys 2019, LA Blockchain Week 2019, E3 2019 blockchain gaming, and a dozen smaller meetups. \n\n**PR Expenses** - Evmos is unique in the Cosmos ecosystem because we are able to tap into a much bigger pool of developers (devs already familiar with solidity). It is my belief that if we are committing $100K into the hackathon, we should do our absolute best to make sure that there is a great turnout with talented developers. \n\nRight off the bat, I would like to explore one or two paid PR placements in Korea's top blockchain publications and developer networks. Depending on who, when, and how, this can range anywhere from $5K to $10K. However, we will aim for the lower-end of the range while leveraging the existing network of IBC frens.\n\nI will be consulting a few blockchain incubation and investment firms that I am acquainted with for additional advice on how to best penetrate the Korean ETH developer market. There may be some last minute promotions, such as small token giveaways or ad placements in developer-heavy social networks. \n\n**Marketing Expenses** - Following the HackAtom event, three events will be held consecutively: buidl.asia, ETH Seoul, and Korea Blockchain Week. This gives us a great opportunity to do further outreach beyond the scope of the hackathon, through smaller meetups, cross-promotions, and related events. Side events, when executed properly, can be much more effective than sponsoring the event itself. \n\nFrom start to finish, the events will last from July 29th to August 13th. This is a pretty epic blockchain marathon, and the possilities and opportunities for developer onboarding, meetups, workships, and side events are endless. \n\n**Booth and Evmos Merch** - Because of the limited time to prepare, booth design and merch will likely have to be rushed. After speaking with Interchain Foundation and the HackAtom organizers, booth design will not require a significant budget.\n\nAround $2K will be allocated for Evmos merch / swag.\n\n### **D. Airfare + Accomodations + Miscellaneous Expenses**\n\nFor those that have boothed at crypto events, you'll know that _it is not easy._ I have discussed with BeeHive, a respected Korean validator and community that is active in Evmos as well as other Cosmos chains, and have confirmed their willingness to help boothing as well as provide translation services. While the event will bring the global community to Seoul, it should be expected that a huge portion of the attendees will, of course be Korean. \n\nAt the moment airfare to Korea from the States as well as Europe are well over $2K. Assuming that four Evmos representaives will in attendance, the cost for airfare should exceed just over $10K. Prices will likely fluctuate between now and then. Accomodation for housing is showing anywhere from $4K to $6K for the time periods of the events.\n\nLoredana from evmos4volunteers has been requested to attend to assist with technical discussions, which the community seems to be overwhelming in favor for. We are waiting for a final confirmation from loredana.\n\n## **Fund Usage, Transparency, and Accountability** \n\n1. All expenses incurred will be documented and itemized, from A to D. Whatever  transactions that can be done on chain will be done so. For expenses that require fiat, an expense report will be provided after the event. \n2. All unused funds will be returned to the community pool.\n3. $20K of the marketing and PR budget will be sent to a multi-sig wallet, while $20K will be held in a liquid wallet so that we can immediately get to work on the countless tasks and preparations that need to be made. \n4. The hackathon prize pool will also be sent to a multi-sig wallet and distributed post-event.\n5. I will work with the core team to be as frugal as possible, while consulting with them to take as many opportunities that would benefit Evmos and help with onboarding and exposure.\n\n## **Time Constraints** \n\nJuly 29th is fast approaching. I will continue to be in constant contact with the HackAtom organizers, blockchain incubators and communities, and everyone in between.\n\n## **Other Considerations** \n\nWe have decided not to sponsor KBW directly, but have confirmed with KBW organizers that whatever side event we decide to host, they will include it in their official list of events, which allows us to tap into their pool of attendees. With that being said, if at any point or time something doesn't feel right, or we feel that our spending is not justified, we can simply decide to not host anything, and return the remaining funds to the community pool.\n\n## Multisig Signatories\n\n3 out of 5 signatories for multisig execution is proposed:\n- LPX (myself, who will be coordinating much of logistics here in Seoul)\n- Three team members / volunteer in attendance (Adonis, Tricky, and Loredana if she is able to make it)\n- One team member not present in Korea.\n\n---\n\nReference Links:\n\n* [HackAtom Seoul 2022 Event Page](https://www.buidl.asia/hackatom-seoul-2022) \n* [Cosmos Signaling Proposal](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-signaling-proposal-hackatom-seoul-2022/6799?u=catdotfish) \n* [Official Cosmos Announcement](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-cosmoss-hackatom-seoul-b6858b9beac7) \n* [HackAtom Official Site](https://hackatom.org/)\n* [ETH Seoul 2022](https://2022.ethseoul.org/)\n* [Blockchain Week Korea 2022](https://koreablockchainweek.com/)\n* [discoverEVMOS](https://evmos.builders)\n\nA huge thank you to [@catdotfish](https://twitter.com/catdotfish) from Interchain and Erica from KryptoSeoul for the help in organizing this proposal.",

        "description": "# Sponsor volunteer researcher for EVM-Inter-Chain lobby for Evmos\n\nFull discussion:\nhttps://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6454-judge-me-sponsor-a-volunteer-researcher-for-evminterchain-lobby-for-evmos\n\n**Loredana's (evmos4volunteers, The Laurel Project) proposal for Evmos:**\n\"Continue my volunteer work on EVM Inter-Chain, by formalizing the protocols, creating new inter-chain standards (like we started with IC_ERC20, IC_ERC721), extending nBridge for CosmWasm (EVM -- CosmWasm nBridge).\nFor this work to have a chance of adoption, I need to be close to Evmos, Cosmos, Interchain Foundation \u0026 other Cosmos blockchain teams. And the best location for me to influence the future tech for the benefit of the Evmos blockchain is Berlin. I would personally like to continue my work remotely and transparently (e.g. github, videos), but I found that it is very hard for other people to collaborate without face-to-face meetings.\n**The Evmos community would only sponsor my rent in Berlin (apartment + office), effectively sponsoring my lobby services, for the benefit of Evmos. My tech effort will remain a volunteer contribution, unpaid.**\n\n## Why should Evmos sponsor lobbying?\nBecause a multi-chain standard (like I am proposing) requires a controller chain to have a correct state view. This controller chain can be Evmos. See my 2 HackATOM videos: https://youtu.be/j5CVliOb-Ck and https://youtu.be/Khqv-1TbsMo .\n\"\n\nIn Berlin, Loredana would be available for technical conferences for the benefit of Evmos.\n\n## Why is Loredana Cirstea the best person for the job?\n* previous volunteering efforts for Evmos: https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/tree/master/evmos\n* has live the only cutting edge chains where you can test inter-chain and multi-chain EVM transactions: https://github.com/the-laurel/demos\n* HackAtom Seoul participation: https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/1.2022-07_HackAtom.md\n* https://loredanacirstea.medium.com/nbridge-inter-chain-erc20-and-how-to-not-get-rekt-by-bridges-unique-assets-shared-security-43f728f05552\n* has done many prototypes and demos demonstrating innovations on Evmos, some live on Mythos.\n\n## Expenses estimate:\n- office: https://www.fullnode.berlin/membership/, FIXED DESK, everyday. 490 € / month.\n- rent: ~2500 € / month (finding an apartment for less than 1 year is more costly; account for EVMOS price instability)\n- TOTAL: 2000 EVMOS / month. Any remaining money can be used for tech or diplomatic purposes (conference expenses, coffee meetings with tech influencers)\n- expenses and output will be tracked transparently [at this link](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/2.2022_08_EvmosCommunityLobbySponsorship.md), as [was done for HackAtom](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/1.2022-07_HackAtom.md#expenses)\n\n## Deliverables:\n- at the end of each month, a detailed list of output [will be on GitHub](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/master/evmos/events/2.2022_08_EvmosCommunityLobbySponsorship.md)\n- for the first 3 weeks the EVM Inter-Chain standards for the most popular EVM standards will be penned\n\n## Timeline:\n- sponsorship is paid 3 months in advance, every three months until the Evmos community decides to stop it.\n- this proposal is only made for 6 months (12000 EVMOS), to give the community a chance to re-vote based on output.\n\n## Multisig Signatories\n2 out of 3 signatories for multisig execution is proposed:\n- Tricky | Cosmos Spaces \n- Outcast | Legion Nodes\n- LPX \n\n## Abstain\nThe evmos4volunteers and votes4volunteers validators will vote Abstain on this proposal.\n",

        "title": "The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO",
        "description": "**Summary:** The Governance workstream is asking the community for a formal awknowledgement and ratification of Evmos DAO's Interim Constitution through this vote.\n\n**Background:** The Governance workstream, with the blessing from the core team, has been working for several months researching case-studies, idealogies and philosophies in decentralized orgs, and all the various governance frameworks and styles of long standing DAOs — all for the eventual launch of Evmos DAO.\n\nIn the best interest of the community and the growth of the Evmos ecosystem, we have decided to move forward with an Interim Constitution to allow the Governance workstream to begin rolling out our governance framework in a modular basis, ultimately allowing for the creation of workstreams and special growth initiatives. The ratification of the Interim Constitution can be seen as the first of many steps in the formation of Evmos DAO.\n\nThis Interim Constitution has been in ideation and discussion for over a month, including [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6082-final-rfc-the-evmos-constitution), The Evmos Validator Fairness Initiative group, and multiple weekly governance calls.\n\n---\n\n# The Interim Constitution of Evmos DAO\n\n## Preamble: The Declaration\n\nWe, the Evmos Community, formally declare our shared beliefs and mission to build and assist in growing the Evmos network. We strive to be the leading EVM network in the Cosmos Ecosystem, utilizing the Cosmos SDK modules, Tendermint's consensus engine, and the Inter Blockchain Protocol for a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant, interoperable chain. The Evmos network, our community, and our governance processes must strive to play a role in laying the foundation for a more equitable, hyper-connected, decentralized future.\n\n## 1. The Evmos Community\n\nThe Evmos Community (\"community\") is a general all-encompassing term that comprises various groups that are participants in the Evmos network. The level and degree of participation may vary by group, but the common denominator of all members of the community should be the shared interest in the continued growth of the Evmos network.\n\n**1. Protocol Developers** - this group of developers focuses mainly on improving the Evmos network on the protocol level; this group includes core developers as well as individual contributors not considered as core team members.\n\n**2. Network Validators** - network validators are key members of the community responsible for securing the network through the Tendermint proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.\n\n**3. Network Delegators** - network delegators are the predominant group that assist in network consensus and security by delegating power to validators through the staking of tokens.\n\n**4. Workstream and Committee Members** - workstream and committee members are those that work to improve and grow the Evmos network on a non-protocol level.\n\n**5. Community Leaders** - workstreams and special projects, although not required, may have an appointed leader to steward and lead his or her group.\n\n**6. Application Developers and End Users** - application developers and end users are those that develop, deploy, utilize, interact, transact, and ultimately bring value to the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nWhile the aforementioned groups make up the majority of the community, the definition and composition of the community are not strictly limited to these groups.\n\n## 2. The Evmos Governance Framework\n\nThe Evmos Governance Framework (\"framework\") is the foundational set of guidelines and processes developed for the community and network contributors to follow and flourish. The framework should be designed to recognize and incentivize contributors and curate a culture that creates long-term, positive-sum interactions between all community members and the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nThe framework is to be proposed and adopted separately from the Constitution. The Constitution shall take priority over the Governance Framework and should be regarded as the supreme guiding document.\n\n## 3. Guiding Principles\n\n**1. Progressive Decentralization:** The Evmos network aims to be as decentralized as possible, in the context of network validation as well as governance and finances. While network resiliency and the decentralization of power is paramount, we recognize the need to proceed with strategic and scientific-based planning. The community must not haphazardly rush into decisions that may potentially destabilize the chain or provoke a strong negative community reaction. The community will take the stance of progressive decentralization as we research and analyze the social, legal, and/or financial ramifications our decisions may potential have.\n\n**2. Neutrality and Non-Partisanship:** We believe in the principles of equality for all and must act in accordance with this core principle. All groups and community members have equal access to information, equal rights, and equal responsibilities, as defined by this Constitution. No one group or community member should be favored over any other members. No one group or community member should be disfavored over any other members. We define \"favor\" as an unfair benefit that is not a direct consequence of provable effort and actions done, in alignment with our mission and goals. We define \"disfavor\" as an unfair punishment or loss of opportunity that is not a direct consequence of provable actions done against Evmos’ mission and goals.\n\n**3. User-Centrism:** Evmos is specialized to provide a unique EVM experience in the Cosmos ecosystem. We must therefore continue to optimize for 1) user adoption and 2) the qualities that contribute to steady growth: network liquidity, improvement of user experience, data sovereignty, stable production of blocks, educational resources, strong governance, etc.\n\n**4. Agnosticism:** Evmos should maintain neutrality as a chain with roots in both the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. While the governance of Evmos may be reliant from time to time on other networks or tools, the Evmos community should retain a stance of neutrality. Community members must leave tribalism at the door; we should refrain from engaging in political debates that are not directly relevant to improving the Evmos network.\n\n**5. Cross-Chain Diplomacy:** Evmos is a network with a long history in the decentralization movement, with inspirations, ideas, protocols, and allies in various networks. Our community will come from a wide range of blockchain communities. Cross-chain collaborations, outreach initiatives, diplomacy missions, and continued participation in events are highly encouraged — especially with chains from the EVM and IBC ecosystems.\n\n**6. Consensual Collaboration:** While the Cosmos SDK’s implementation of governance is relatively permissionless, this does not mean anyone is entitled to work or compensation. Proposals will be assessed by the community on their merits alone and eventually voted on. In addition, proposals must follow the Governance Framework of the Evmos network and adhere to the principles outlined in the Constitution.\n\n**7. Sovereignty to Work:** The purpose of the Governance Framework is not to micro-manage proposals or teams. Sovereignty will be given to those that are working in accordance with the original proposal passed by the community, and are not in violation of any governance processes or principles of the Constitution.\n\n## 4. Removal of Community Leaders\n\nAll community members appointed to a role of higher responsibility, including workstream members, may be removed via a formal vote on-chain. The Governance Framework shall outline the appointment, removal, and appeals process, along with a detailed dispute resolution guideline.\n\n## 5. Constitutional Rights\n\nThe Governance workstream shall amend a Bill of Rights to the Constitution as soon as a general consensus can be confidently reached.\n\n## 6. Constitutional Amendments and Revisions\n\nThe community holds the power to propose an amendment to the Constitution by following the standard Evmos Proposal Lifecycle. The reasoning for the amendment must be justified and petitioned. If possible, there should be an attempt made to resolve the issue before a proposal for amendment is initiated.\n\n---\n\n**Validator/Community Code of Conduct and Constitutional Rights**\n\nWe recognize that this Constitution is missing a few key topics — however, we also see the need to tread carefully in these sensitive and controversial topics. While it is inarguable that these are necessary components of the Constitution, there was clear signaling that we needed more time to allow for the natural growth of the community before we could formally ratify some sections with confidence. We pledge to continue our research and continue to engage with the community to find general consensus on the best step forward. While some topics will be amended into the Constitution when they are ready, most will likely be implemented through the Governance Framework.\n\n---\n\n# Your Votes... \n\n**By voting YES**, you are signing the Constitution to be ratified so that the Governance workstream can shift focus and begin introducing components of the the Governance Framework that will allow for the creation of more  workstreams and special growth projects / committees / teams. Voting YES does not necessarily mean that you are fully content — but you will allow it.\n\n**By voting ABSTAIN**, you are signaling that you did not read the Constitution or do not understand its content or its purpose.\n\n**By voting NO**, you refuse to accept the Constitution at its current state.\n\n**By voting NO WITH VETO**, you are showing complete opposition to the Constitution and would rather leave the community than to have it ratified at its current state."

        "description": "Full discussion: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6662-ideation-fund-dia-randomness-orcale-gas-fees-for-1-year \n Hi All, \n 0xCtrlAltApe here from the Orbital Apes team. I am starting this discussion to help launch DIA Randomness Oracles on Evmos. I am not affiliated with the DIA team in anyway.\n DIA provides an on-chain randomness oracle solution for EVM chains. If deployed the randomness oracle can be used by any smart contract on Evmos. While the DIA team does not charge for oracle usage, they do ask that gas fees to maintain the oracle are provided to launch on a new chain. By the DIA teams estimations this would be roughly 44 evmos/day which equals to 16060 Evmos for the year.\n Randomness oracles will allow for more innovative and new types of applications to be built on Evmos. Currently there are no options available for randomness on-chain on Evmos. As this oracle can be used for free by any dev/team on Evmos after deployment I believe that covering gas fees is an appropriate use of community funds.\n Funds will be sent to a (2/3) multisig managed by:\n 0xCtrlAltApe (Orbital Apes team member)\n Liam (Evmos team member)\n Samuel Brack (DIA team member)\n These funds can be sent to the DIA team on a monthly basis to cover gas costs for the randomness oracle. The fees earned from the fee-spilt module in Evmos v8 will be used to continue funding the oracle gas fees.",

        "description": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal is the second iteration of the original proposal posted on Commonwealth on the 19th of July.  We are seeking community funding for our previous work as well as future efforts in indexing the Evmos network for the Covalent Unified API, along with the launch of the Evmos-Covalent Joint *#OneMillionWallets* Hackathon\n\n - **Covalent will continue to index the Evmos network and receive a compensation of 100K USD, which will be staked entirely and delegated to lower validators.**\n - **Covalent will run a joint hackathon with Evmos to onboard more developers, and explore and kickstart novel use cases for the Evmos ecosystem with a prize pool of $100K.**\n - **The total ask is $200K in Evmos tokens - The amount of tokens for the hackathon prizes of $100k will be determined at time of dispersement. In the case of extreme price volatility, the Governance workstream will assist in readjusting the community pool funding request.** \n\n\nNote: Because of the character limit of Cosmos SDK's governance module, some portions of the proposal have been left out and the proposal has been modified for on-chain submission with the help of the Evmos DAO Governance Workstream. View the full proposal on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6603-prevote-covalent-apis-integration-of-evmos-and-joint-hackathon). \n\n## Background\n\nAt Covalent, we believe blockchain technologies can change the world, but this potential is left unfulfilled if the data is not accessible. Despite the proliferation of on-chain digital assets, current solutions require developers to spend hours writing additional code to query granular blockchain data.\n\nCovalent is the only multi-chain API that provides every single point of on-chain data - directly from the browser. With no extra code, you need just one API call to query any piece of data across +40 blockchains.\n\n - +40 blockchains indexed, including  Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, BNB, Ethereum, Evmos, Fantom, Harmony, Ronin, Moonbeam \u0026 Polygon\n - +30K developers, and\n - +3K live projects, including 0x, Aave, CoinGecko, ConsenSys, DappRadar, NFTX, ParaSwap, Sovryn, Uniswap, XDEFI Wallet \u0026 Zerion\n - +2.5M calls made to Evmos using Covalent's Unified API\n\n**Evmos API Call Volume Growth (Month over Month)**\n\n- June 2022 -- 2M / +312%\n - May 2022 -- 500K / +170,489%\n - April 2022 -- 282 / +14,000%\n - March 2022 -- 2\n\nCovalent's vision is to empower the pioneers of tomorrow by providing the most robust data infrastructure for the entire blockchain ecosystem, delivering complete transparency and visibility to all on-chain digital assets.\n\n## API Endpoints for Evmos\n\n- Class A endpoints - These return enriched blockchain data applicable to all blockchain networks\n - Class B endpoints - These are for a specific protocol on a blockchain\n - Class C endpoints - This will be a community-driven market where users can create API endpoints for their projects\n - DEX \u0026 NFT marketplace data (i.e., EvmoSwap, Diffusion) \u0026 more to be integrated as the number of protocols grow. \n - Covalent will be indexing the entirety of Evmos' on-chain data\n\nMore details about our API can be found in [Evmos | Covalent Docs](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/evmos/) \n\n## Timeline\n\n**The indexing of Evmos has already been completed and the completion was publicly announced on 30 May 2022. The indexing of Evmos is currently live, and freely available for developers.**\n\n- 30 May - 15 August 2022 -- A proposal to index Evmos is floated in the Evmos governance forum.\n - 22 September 2022 -- The joint hackathon registration goes live.\n - 22 October 2022 -- The Joint '#OneMillionWallets' Hackathon begins.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nPre-integration and Post-integration deliverables can be viewed in the [full proposal here](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6603-prevote-covalent-apis-integration-of-evmos-and-joint-hackathon). \n\n## Funding \u0026 Disbursement\n\nThe EVMOS/USD exchange rate for the disbursements is to be determined according to the exchange rate at which the disbursements are made. \n\n- API and Indexing: 100K USD of Evmos  tokens will be released upon the passing of the proposal. **Covalent will stake the compensation and delegate it to lower validators** for up to one year. \n - #OneMillionWallets Hackathon: Roughly $100K in Evmos will be used to host the joint hackathon. \n\n The funds will be released initially to a 3 of 4-person multisig wallet with the following signatories: \n - Leibing, Dev Relations @ Covalent \n - Daniel, Data Journalist @ Covalent \n - LPX, Evmos DAO Governance \n - Benny Lava, Evmos DAO \u0026 Community Mod\n\n**Multisig deployment address:** 0x05a6991caD6B2258Bc5c7FE2b0793Af93590DbD0\n\nCovalent has an impressive track record of successful hackathons for Layer-1 networks. Past outcomes, marketing plans, and Evmos bounty tracks can be read in detail in the [full proposal](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6603-prevote-covalent-apis-integration-of-evmos-and-joint-hackathon).",

        "description": "## INCUBATION PROPOSAL\n**Sriram Vishwanath (Professor, University of Texas Austin)**\n**ChainHub \u0026 Texas Blockchain Incubator**\n**sriram@chainhub.net**\n# INTRODUCTION\nThis proposal details an incubation partnership agreement between ChainHub (the incubation arm of Texas Blockchain) and The Evmos Community. ChainHub is an incubator, currently based in Austin TX (which is expanding to Pittsburg, PA and other cities in the USA in coming months) focused on University students and College Blockchain clubs. ChainHub actively incubates projects from The University of Texas, Austin and the surrounding Austin community, and post-expansion, will be incubating projects from Carnegie Mellon University as well as other Universities/Colleges within the USA.\nChainHub is managed by Sriram Vishwanath. Sriram is a Professor of Engineering at The University of Texas, Austin. He has a PhD from Stanford, an MS from Caltech and a BTech from IIT Madras. He is one of the founders of Texas Blockchain ([https://www.texasblockchain.org/](https://www.texasblockchain.org/)) and he teaches the engineering and software centric blockchain classes on University of Texas Austin campus.\nLinkedin Profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/)\n# OUR EXPERIENCE\nTexas Blockchain has been working on projects within the blockchain/crypto domain for roughly 5 years, and ChainHub is its incubation arm. We currently incubate projects within two other ecosystems: Polkadot and NEAR, and we have similar agreements in place with each of the ecosystems. Some of the incubated projects include: The Quai Network [https://quai.network/](https://quai.network/), Zyfty [https://zyfty.io/#/](https://zyfty.io/#/), Mirror World [https://www.mirrormy.world/](https://www.mirrormy.world/) and a few other projects still in stealth.\nChainHub proposes to work with Evmos to incubate approximately two projects a year, on a calendar year basis, tailored to Evmos's priorities and needs. To this end, we will work closely with Evmos to converge on two or more projects and bring together a highly capable team to deliver on each project. These teams will be mentored, managed and funded by ChainHub through a grant provided by Evmos (see budget request below).\n# SUMMARY OF TERMS\n1. ChainHub will:\n1. Incubate approximately two projects per year, starting with September 2022. These projects will be selected in close coordination with the Evmos team.\n2. Support these projects from their inception to minimum viable product (MVP) completion. We will staff each project with a talented and passionate team of students/alumni from the Universities/Colleges with which we are co-located.\n2. Evmos will:\n1. The Evmos Foundation will work closely with ChainHub to identify projects and mentor each project team.\n2. The Evmos Community ChainHub (see budget request below) will provide resources necessary towards execution.\n3. The Evmos Foundation will partner with each project team: help with pitch-deck/fundraising, product roadmap and long term strategic growth of each entity resulting from this incubation process.\nWith the exception of 2022, ChainHub will submit a new proposal in Q1 of each calendar year for the Evmos Community's consideration for renewal of this engagement for that calendar year.\n# BUDGET REQUEST\nAs tokens are volatile and ChainHub/Texas Blockchain will bear all the costs of development of the project, we request $1M in tokens per calendar year for the duration of this incubation agreement. This will cover the costs of project incubation (including developers, designers, audits, incubation space and operational support for each project).\nWe request the tokens be provided as follows:\n\nThe first 50% at kickoff with Evmos (206611 Evmos equivalent to $0.5M)\n2. The next 25% when the first project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (103305 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n3.The final 25% when the second project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (103305 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M).\n\nA breakdown of costs across the two projects are (these are rough order of magnitude):\n1. Engineering Team/Developers/Product Lead - 700K\n2. Full time Designer (for both projects) - 75K\n3. Incubation space - 75K (covers space rent, utilities, laptops, monitors, all infrastructure including 6 servers)\n4. Audits - 75K (for the entire platform(s) including full stack software, not just the smart contracts)\n5. Operational Staff (payroll/HR/health insurance/misc software) - 75K\nEach engineering team/devs/product lead will comprise of: approximately 3 Web3 + backend engineers, 2 part-time or full time front-end engineers, and 1 product lead.\n\nThe tokens will be staked and existing incubator resources will be used until those resources are exhausted. When exhausted, we will primarily aim to use OTC services to convert tokens to USD. When OTC services are unavailable or limited, we will use other means of conversion to USD. If OTC services are unavailable, we will limit ourselves to at most 30K a month in conversion to USD.\nA multisig will be setup to manage this schedule by members of the community. When the Evmos Foundation marks a particular project's MVP as complete, the associated tranche of tokens will be released to ChainHub.\n\nLink to commonwealth discussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6822-incubation-proposal-chainhubtexas-blockchain-projects-for-evmos](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6822-incubation-proposal-chainhubtexas-blockchain-projects-for-evmos)",

        "description": "## Author\\n\\nDaniel Burckhardt ([@danburck](https://twitter.com/danburck)), Evmos Core Team\\n\\n## Software Upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\\n\\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos software upgrade at block height [4,655,500](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/4655500) from it's current version [v7.0.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v7.0.0) to [v8.1.0](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.1.0).\\n\\n## Motivation\\n\\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on testnet and then on mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\\n\\n## Impact\\n\\nOn a high level, the v8.1.0 software includes the following improvements:\\n\\n* [Feesplit module](https://docs.evmos.org/modules/feesplit/): Developers can register their smart contracts and earn rewards everytime someone interacts with their registered smart contract\\n* Upgrade to Ethermint [v0.19.2](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/releases/tag/v0.19.2): Improves JSON-RPC reliability and maintainability and bumps SDK, Tendermint and IAVL dependencies and adds supports for optional params on EIP712\\n* Upgrade ibc-go to [v3.2.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.2.0) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.45.7]\\n\\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v8.1.0).\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nPrior to this proposal the version v8.1.0 is been upgraded to and tested on the [Evmos Testnet](https://testnet.mintscan.io/evmos-testnet/proposals/72).\\n\\nAdditionally, the Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md).\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6653-evmos-software-upgrade-v810).",

        "description": "# Ethermint Funding Proposal For Past Development, Addressed from The Evmos Community to The Kava Community\n\nThis is an inter-chain diplomacy proposal for the Evmos Community to ask the Kava Community to reward [Ethermint past development efforts](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/graphs/contributors) (done until September 1st 2022), with 2.5M (2,500,000) EVMOS.\n\n$Kava tokens will be used to buy $EVMOS.\nOn Evmos, the 2.5M $EVMOS will be used for Ethermint development, following a similar procedure to Evmos Grants:\n- stake the $EVMOS to active validators that have under 0.66% voting power, to improve Evmos's Nakamoto Coefficient\n- fund Ethermint development from staking rewards\n\nMultisig on Evmos: 0xd04DB421f518D0E3449D2A3cefEac25b31485c71\n- Mr.Sir | Orbital Apes\n- InstaFinanzas | Stakin\n- LPX | Evmos Governance\n- arda | Validator.run\n- luisqa | OzMage Validation\n\nMultisig on Kava will be created with the same composition if this proposal will pass.\n\nDiscussion on Evmos: https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6867-external-ethermint-funding-proposal-on-kava-price-discovery-vote\nGovernance Council Discussions: https://youtu.be/Pn_u6WyiQ6c?t=544, https://youtu.be/n-XaFrDV7mE?t=677\nMultisig signers discussion: https://discord.com/channels/809048090249134080/913597332073898034/1020236682907353212\n\n## Summary of Facts\n\n- [Ethermint](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/graphs/contributors) is a Go module that bridges the Cosmos APIs (Cosmos SDK, Tendermint, IBC, etc) to EVM (using the [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) library as module). It is the de-facto way to have EVM-powered Cosmos chains.\n- Ethermint's is developed and maintained by Tharsis \u0026 other contributors \u0026 volunteers.\n- [Kava](https://www.kava.io/) is \"One Network. Two Chains. Ethereum and Cosmos.\"\n- Kava is today valued at ~$400M market cap\n- Estimated total value locked: ~$140M\n- Initial investment in building and marketing Kava is less than $1M\n- \"Kava Rise Program: $750M Developer Incentive Program. The structure of the Rise program will focus primarily on driving adoption and growth for the new Ethereum Co-Chain.\"\n- Kava Community Pool has ~80M KAVA tokens\n- Kava uses Ethermint for their Ethereum Co-Chain and Cosmos SDK for Cosmos in [their code](https://github.com/Kava-Labs)\n- Tharsis made [this Commonwealth proposal](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6684-external-evm-infrastructure-funding-proposal-on-kava) to the Evmos and Kava communities, \"requesting 3M out of ~80M KAVA tokens (3.7%) from the Kava Community Pool Treasury to fund, develop and advance critical EVM Infrastructure through the Ethermint Engineering and R\u0026D team for 1 year.\", followed by opening a [Kava Community Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/wsa37v/evm_infrastructure_funding_proposal_on_kava/). Resulting in the formal [on-chain Kava proposal #96](https://www.mintscan.io/kava/proposals/96)\n- Proposal #96 was rejected. 13/21 of the top validators votes YES, 1/21 voted ABSTAIN, and 7/21 did not vote. The top 21 validators have 88.90% voting power. Kava's co-founder \u0026 CEO's [response](https://twitter.com/Scott_Stuart_/status/1563228443436728321).\n- Kava Labs made its own \"Kava Infrastructure Security rewards\" [proposal #97](https://www.mintscan.io/kava/proposals/97), with no mention of funding Ethermint, as critical infrastructure. With no link to any Kava Community discussion. This proposal passed.\n- \"The Kava DAO is a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs the Kava Network. Made up of the Kava stakers and validators that help to secure and run the network\"\n- Kava did not make any concrete offers to reward past development efforts for Ethermint\n\n## Why the Evmos Community has standing?\n\n- Evmos uses Ethermint as core infrastructure\n- Tharsis has most funds from the $EVMOS coin growth, so the Evmos chain became the de-facto treasurer for Tharsis\n- The Evmos Community are the guardians of Evmos interests, which include Ethermint and the well-being of Tharsis devs\n\n## Inter-Chain Diplomacy\n\nRight now, Ethermint tech is an exportable product from the Evmos chain to all other chains that do not make development effort towards it (but use it), therefore the payment should be in $EVMOS.\n\nThe Evmos community now has the standing to make a funding proposal in the name of Tharsis, in $EVMOS, first on the Evmos governance, then on Kava.\n\nGiven that the Kava Community rejected the request for funding Ethermint's future development, for 1 year, we propose that another funding request should be made to Kava by the Evmos Community, for past development efforts, that have already taken place and have already brought value to Kava. Any other future funding requests will be discussed separately.\n\nOff-chain polls \u0026 discussion for price discovery were opened in [Evmos Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6867-external-ethermint-funding-proposal-on-kava-price-discovery-vote).\n\n## What will Kava stand to gain?\n\nEthermint will enter the most technically interesting phase: custom precompiles and EVM-Inter-Chain. Working prototypes already exist and were presented https://youtu.be/x75UobIr4qo?t=14670 and the ground work for Ethermint was set with https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/pull/1272.\n\n(proposal lead:) I have personally developed the Go groundwork for inter-chain cooperation and deployed three public technical blockchains with EVM-Cosmos (Mythos, Ethos, and Logos), for demoing the inter-chain tech and I will re-base my work on the Ethermint extensibility of EVM precompiles.\nSome precompiles that I created that are pertinent to this:\n- abstract accounts (implementing account abstraction for EVM https://hackmd.io/@matt/r1neQ_B38)\n- quasar: ability to run Cosmos transactions from EVM\n- IBC precompile for EVM\n- nBridge: n-way (n\u003e=2) generalized bridge by transaction replay\n(Demos at: https://www.youtube.com/c/LoredanaCirstea/videos)\n\nNext generation protocols are inter-chain. If Kava rewards past Ethermint development efforts, and demonstrates will to collaborate, it has a chance to be invited to benefit from the EVM-Inter-Chain innovations. This is no longer Ethermint, it is next-generation Ethermint (with extensions) and licensing may be subjected to change if context requires it.\nWe hope the Kava Community will not choose the short-term frugality over long-term greater benefits. Especially that this is an ethical opportunity that benefits Kava as image, Evmos, and the whole Cosmos.\n\n\n## Why should the Cosmos Community care?\n\n1. Blockchains are entities with communities. So, we need to have rules for behaving between chains. The proposal is bringing clarity to what is civil between chains (in this case, pertaining to funding previous dev efforts). Rejecting a proposal from Tharsis is different than rejecting a proposal from the Evmos Community. Kava and Evmos are part of the larger Cosmos Inter-Chain ecosystem.\n2. This proposal's purpose is to find a general way to determine a fair ask for any other chains, not only Kava.\n3. Ethermint is a core piece of infrastructure that brings value to Cosmos. The Cosmos Community should fight to keep it open-source and well-developed.\n4. Fairly rewarding effort made to evolve Cosmos is critical to inter-chain cooperation.\n5. Upholding the values of decentralized governance in each chain is a critical requirement for any inter-chain cooperation.\n\n\n## Votes\n\nIf you vote YES: This proposal will be posted on Kava's subreddit, for Kava Community feedback. And then, as an on-chain proposal to the Kava Community.\n\n\n## Proposal Lead\n\nThis proposal was led on behalf of the Evmos Community, by Loredana Cirstea - elected by vote in the Evmos Interchain Office (Evmos Governance proposal #45) and a volunteer from The Laurel Project (https://evolve.provable.dev/). This proposal is made from a volunteer capacity (independent, unpaid, self-funded, and from the heart).\n"

        "title": "Launching the Evmos Liquidity Incentives Program",
        "description": "## Summary \n\nThis proposal, also known as [\"Kickstart DeFi on Evmos\"](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6977-prevote-kickstart-defi-on-evmos) from Commonwealth, will begin the Evmos DAO Liquidity Incentives Program with the bootstrapping of liquidity pools on the Diffusion DEX. More initiatives are in the works with other DeFi projects, and will be proposed when ready.\n\n## Motivation \n\nThe Evmos blockchain has the potential to become a unique environment for DeFi in the IBC ecosystem, but it has had its fair share of roadblocks that have slowed down and limited growth. We have also had very attractive staking APR that gave a higher return than most liquidity pools, and a bridge exploit that destroyed the TVL of Evmos DeFi in a matter of hours.\n\nDespite the hurdles, we are confident in saying that we had great success with our incentivization initiative for the EVMOS/OSMO pool through Prop 39 which provided 600,000 EVMOS tokens for external incentives over 90 days on the Osmosis DEX. Since then, EVMOS has become one of the most popular pools on Osmosis in nearly all areas including TVL, volume, and daily APRs. At the time of writing, the pool has grown from just $2M, now to the 5th largest pool on osmosis with a TVL of $9.8M and one of the highest volume pools of over $3M. The incentives that helped drive this success will be expiring soon, and while we do plan on extending the Osmosis program, we must also begin looking inward: our native TVL.\n\n## Strategy \n\nAs more EVMOS tokens are staked, the APR rates have been decreasing at an accelerated rate. Millions of tokens are being unbonded at this moment, and without alternative pools with very appealing rates, they will most likely be going to Osmosis to be sold. Our first priority is to 1) build the much needed liquidity to wean off our reliance on Osmosis pools for liquid markets; 2) attract fellow IBC friends to participate in our high rewards programs and attract the unbonding Evmos tokens to find its way into these incentivized pools.\n\nThe Community Treasury is currently sitting around 33mil EVMOS tokens with 75mil+ EVMOS tokens returning from the unclaimed airdrops, and with an usage incentives escrow wallet which is now nearing 35mil tokens.\n\nIn total, roughly 143mil EVMOS (~$357mil @ $2.5), is left sitting with no benefits, when they can be put to strategic use that not only encourages more network participants, but also brings the community rewards for helping with the bootstrap initiative.\n\nIn summary, this is an aggressive but needed first step in further growing the Evmos network. Liam from Evmos explains eloquently in [this comment](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/6977-prevote-kickstart-defi-on-evmos?comment=30063) why this proposal is so important. We highly suggest reading the comment for context.\n\n ## Plan of Action \n\nDiffusion will be the first DEX to receive incentives, as they have been the leading DEX prior to the Nomad exploit. More protocols and DeFi projects will follow, with programs of their own.\n\nDiffusion will continue with their DIFF rewards for existing pools, resulting in *double rewards* for the pools that will be incentivized further with Evmos tokens.\n\n2mil EVMOS tokens will be released into a Gnosis Safe (3/5 signatures). Over the course of 90 days, the allocated EVMOS rewards will be released into Diffusion's staking contract (MiniChefv2 \u0026 Audited). We are initially aiming to minimize risk by releasing the funds every two weeks allowing time for assessments, and if needed, the re-balancing of rewards for underperforming pools. \n\nThe multisig will be managed by: \n\n- 3 Evmos DAO Governance members (Benny Lava, Tricky, LPX)\n- 1 Diffusion team member (mercenaryApe)\n- 1 Validator (Swiss Staking)\n\n## Incentives Allocations \n\nThe EVMOS incentives will go towards attracting liquidity for EVMOS pairs with ATOM, WETH, WBTC, OSMO, JUNO, DIFF, and USDC pools. The EVMOS token incentive breakdown for those pools would be as follows:\n\n**Category: Major (50%)**\n\n- EVMOS / ATOM - 400k \n- EVMOS / wETH - 400k (200k each Axelar, Celer) \n- EVMOS / wBTC - 200k (66.7K each Axelar, Gravity Bridge, Celer)\n\n**Category: Stablecoins (35%)**\n\n- EVMOS / Stablecoins - 700k (USDC split evenly between Axelar and Celer -- USDT and DAI for Gravity Bridge)\n\n**Category: Minor (15%)**\n\n- EVMOS / OSMO - 100k \n- EVMOS / JUNO - 100k \n- EVMOS / DIFF - 100k \n\nFor the kickoff program, we propose the equal distribution of incentives between the bridged assets **with the exception of gUSDC and gWETH pools**, as they are already being incentivized and are locked into smart contracts for the time being. This distribution will take course over a 90 day period.\n\n**Rebalancing of Pool Allocations** - Over the first 14 days funds will be split evenly between pools in each category, followed by distribution proportionate to each pool's TVL \u0026 Volume accordingly. 50% of the category incentives based upon TVL, and 50% based upon volume to fairly distribute incentives to the most valuable pools.\n\nRough TVL and APR targets per pool: [Graphical Table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16395727/192321522-df012984-1edf-4a39-b9df-b3d959a532c5.png) \n\n## Future Plans \n\nFuture proposals can use this data to gauge their own bridge incentives. This will help the most desired liquidity continue to come onto Evmos and maintain attractive APRs while doing so. We are currently aiming to hit a TVL of $20mil on Evmos by the end of the year (across the entire network).\n\n2mil EVMOS is less than 1.5% of our available funds, and covers an entire DEX including interchain assets on Evmos. When compared to the 0.5% spent for a single EVMOS/OSMO pool, we firmly believe that this kickoff initiative is reasonable. We are currently working on a standardized framework in which these processes can be streamlined and more transparent; we thank the community for your patience and thank you to all those that have participated in the discussion stage of the proposal.\n\n**About Diffusion:**\n\nDiffusion is the a Uniswap v2 fork with Sushi's MinichefV2 implemented for rewards distribution. Diffusion was the first DEX and by far the largest in TVL and volume before the Nomad hack. With stablecoins back on Evmos and incentives to give them a boost, the revitalized team will soon be releasing a new roadmap and their plans to continually improve the DEX.\n\n---\n\n**Meta**\n\nIPFS: https://bafybeiftslqvljku5szkumbeoy3s2fje5j56xio5mwydxpxbnajcvunpwa.ipfs.w3s.link/ECP-PS-1.md \nMultisig: [0x35C237Bab19e5B89708f8513b75FF0F07A3c2a09](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0x35C237Bab19e5B89708f8513b75FF0F07A3c2a09) (evmos1xhpr0w43nedcjuy0s5fmwhls7parc2sfs33xef)",

In the past, Kinesis Labs has reached over 459k USD worth of stablecoins in TVL without any incentives, with over 11,000 transactions and 400 unique liquidity providers. However, with the recent Nomad hack, Evmos needs a way to boostrap liquidity to jump start the Evmos DeFi ecosystem. Please note that all of these funds will be distributed to liquidity providers on Kinesis through the minichef contract - these funds are not for the Kinesis Team nor anyone else. Additionally, we are building Kinesis as members of the Evmos community as a public good. We do not take any fees.\n\nLink to Full Proposal: https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXKzWgYjB9hhNpC5CTqdfRAXBg4e7ddPEdaBXDc7iE13v",

        "description": "###\n# INCUBATION PROPOSAL\n\n**Sriram Vishwanath (Professor, University of Texas Austin)**\n\n**ChainHub \u0026 Texas Blockchain Incubator**\n\n**sriram@chainhub.net**\n\n#### INTRODUCTION\n\nThis proposal details an incubation partnership agreement between ChainHub (the incubation arm of Texas Blockchain) and The Evmos Community. ChainHub is an incubator, currently based in Austin TX (which is expanding to other cities in the USA in coming months) focused on University students and College Blockchain clubs. ChainHub actively incubates projects from The University of Texas, Austin and the surrounding Austin community and, post-expansion, will be incubating projects from Carnegie Mellon University as well as other Universities/Colleges within the USA.\n\nChainHub is managed by Sriram Vishwanath. Sriram is a Professor of Engineering at The University of Texas, Austin. He has a PhD from Stanford, an MS from Caltech and a BTech from IIT Madras. He is the faculty sponsor and founding faculty advisor of Texas Blockchain ([https://www.texasblockchain.org/](https://www.texasblockchain.org/)) and he teaches the engineering and software centric blockchain classes on University of Texas Austin campus.\n\nLinkedin Profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriramvishwanath/)\n\n#### OUR EXPERIENCE\n\nTexas Blockchain has been working on projects within the blockchain/crypto domain for roughly 5 years, and ChainHub is its incubation arm. We currently incubate projects within two other ecosystems: Polkadot and NEAR, and we have similar agreements in place with each of the ecosystems. Some of the incubated projects include: Quai Network [https://quai.network/](https://quai.network/), Zyfty [https://zyfty.io/#/](https://zyfty.io/#/), Mirror World [https://www.mirrormy.world/](https://www.mirrormy.world/) and a few other projects still in stealth.\n\nChainHub proposes to work with Evmos to incubate approximately two projects a year, on a calendar year basis, tailored to Evmos's priorities and needs. To this end, we will work closely with Evmos to converge on two or more projects and bring together a highly capable team to deliver on each project. These teams will be mentored, managed and funded by ChainHub through a grant provided by Evmos (see budget request below).\n\n#### SUMMARY OF TERMS\n\n1. ChainHub will:\n  \n      a. Incubate approximately[^1] two projects per year, starting with September 2022. These projects will be selected in close coordination with the Evmos team.\n  \n      b. Support these projects from their inception to minimum viable product (MVP) completion. We will staff each project with a talented and passionate team of students/alumni from the Universities/Colleges with which we are co-located.\n2. Evmos will:\n\n1. The Evmos Foundation will work closely with ChainHub to identify projects and mentor each project team.\n2. The Evmos Community (see budget request below) will provide resources necessary towards execution.\n3. The Evmos Foundation will partner with each project team: help with pitch-deck/fundraising, product roadmap and long term strategic growth of each entity resulting from this incubation process.\n\nWith the exception of 2022, ChainHub will submit a new proposal in Q1 of each calendar year for the Evmos Community's consideration for renewal of this engagement for that calendar year.\n\n#### BUDGET REQUEST\n\nAs tokens are volatile and ChainHub/Texas Blockchain will bear all the costs of development of the project, we request $1M in tokens per calendar year for the duration of this incubation agreement. This will cover the costs of project incubation (including developers, designers, audits, incubation space and operational support for each project).\n\nWe request the tokens be provided as follows:\n\n1. The first 50% at kickoff with Evmos (310559 Evmos equivalent to $0.5M)\n2. The next 25% when the first project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (155279 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n3. The final 25% when the second project is determined to be completed by Evmos Foundation (155279 Evmos equivalent to $0.25M)\n\nA breakdown of costs across the two projects are (these are rough order of magnitude):\n\n1. Engineering Team/Developers/Product Lead - 625K\n2. Full time Designer (for both projects) - 75K\n3. Incubation space - 100K (covers space rent, utilities, laptops, monitors, all infrastructure including 6 servers)\n4. Audits - 125K (for the entire platform(s) including full stack software, not just the smart contracts)\n5. Operational Staff (payroll/HR/health insurance/misc software) - 75K\n\nEach engineering team/devs/product lead will comprise of: approximately 2 Web3 + backend engineers, 1 part-time or full time front-end engineers, and 1 product lead.\n\nThe initial 500K worth of Evmos token will be used to fund development to reach the funding milestones. These tokens and existing incubator resources will be used until those resources are exhausted. We will primarily aim to use OTC services to convert tokens to USD. When OTC services are unavailable or limited, we will use other means of conversion to USD. If OTC services are unavailable, we will limit ourselves to at most 50K a month in conversion to USD. The remaining 500K worth of Evmos will be staked until their corresponding development milestones are reached. \n\nA multisig will be set up to manage this schedule by members of the community. When the Evmos Foundation marks a particular project's MVP as complete, the associated tranche of tokens will be released to ChainHub.\n\n#### MULTISIG COMPOSITION\nThe multisig composition is 3/5. The signers are as follows:\n- Loredana | The Laurel Project\n- Liam | Tharsis\n- Tricky | EvmosDAO\n- Outcast | Legion Validators\n- Chainhub\n\n#### PROPOSED PROJECTS\n\n1. **EvLend**\n\nProject Specs: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZfxh8KBtf4r1ZFaJ9Za6jaYVH1FjbTR8y16TeLVAiT7s](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZfxh8KBtf4r1ZFaJ9Za6jaYVH1FjbTR8y16TeLVAiT7s)\n\nEvLend aims to be the most efficient variable rate borrow-lend market on Evmos.\n\nEvLend uses reactive interest rate technology to target specific utilization rates (% of funds in the money market being borrowed) for stablecoin assets while still providing support for borrow \u0026 lend services to other assets.\n\nReactive interest rates are a more recent innovation popularized by Euler finance. EvLend takes the power of this concept and maximizes it for stablecoin markets.\n\nEvLend can demonstrate a standard model by which maximum efficiency of interest rates may be reached. Building such a system can lead to economies of scale and majority share of lending volume for a given core stablecoin.\n\nThe lead developer for EvLend is Max Feldman.\n\nHere is a video walk-through of the documentation by the team: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG0uZpD26w8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG0uZpD26w8) \n\nMore information on reactive rates, our stablecoin focus, and project development timeline can be found in the GitBook specs link above.\n\n2. **Evmos Bridge**\n\nProject Specs: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ91nSC5ZDun6xw5Kuc4agMnfX7i4y5fKPe5ESqchSWox](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQ91nSC5ZDun6xw5Kuc4agMnfX7i4y5fKPe5ESqchSWox)\n\nWe propose a bridge tailored to maximize the ease of onboarding into the Evmos ecosystem. Our solution focuses on supporting the most bridge paths into and out of Evmos as well as focusing on user education to increase usage within the Evmos and broader Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nThe proposed bridge will consist of a liquidity network architecture utilizing native assets and thus no minting and burning. Additionally, we will build the cross-chain protocol leveraging a battle tested security and consensus model that is as secure as the economic security of the blockchains it is built upon.\n\nWith the minimal bridge paths available today, Evmos will continue to struggle with onboarding users and value into the ecosystem.\n\nProviding routes for users to bridge from the most popular DeFi hubs streamlines the process to onboard value into Evmos by orders of magnitude. By the end of Q3 2023 we plan on having Evmos, Ethereum, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism integrated into the network.\n\nAdditionally, Chainhub will be resposible for running and maintaining the required validators for the liquidity network while this contract is active.\n\nThe lead developer for Evmos Bridge is Thad Hutcheson: \n\nHere is a video walk-through of the documentation by the team: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjqmVj5UhVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjqmVj5UhVk)\n\nFor more information regarding the specifications of the bridge please refer to the documentation or reach back out to us for any further questions.\n\n[^1]: We say \"approximate\" as we may not converge on two projects, or may converge on more than two per year. Our goal will remain to incubate at least two per year.",

        "description": "## INCUBATION PROPOSAL\n\n **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to extend the external EVMOS incentives for the EVMOS/OSMO pool on Osmosis. 600,000 EVMOS will be distributed to 14 day bonding only over 90 days. The total ask is for 600,100 EVMOS to also cover the external incentives gauge fees. The funds will be sent to a 3/4 multisig upon approval to deploy the incentives on Osmosis. You can find the commonwealth discussion here: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7102-temperature-check-extending-osmosis-external-incentives](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7102-temperature-check-extending-osmosis-external-incentives)\n\n **Motivation**\n\nWe have had great success with incentivizing the EVMOS/OSMO pool on Osmosis through Prop 39 and providing 600,000 EVMOS tokens for external incentives over 90 days. Since then, EVMOS has become one of the most popular pools on Osmosis through TVL, volume, and daily APRs. At the time of writing, the pool has grown from just $2M, now to the 6th largest pool on osmosis with a TVL of $7.3M (Peaking at $10M) and 3rd highest 7-day volume of $6.5M. The number of tokens locked in the LP have grown from 700k EVMOS before the incentives started to now just over 2M. Deep \u0026 stable liquidity is important for the health of every protocol, and incentives can play a key part in maintaining this liquidity. The incentives that helped drive this success will be expiring on October 18th, so the community needs to decide the next steps forward.\n\n **Plan of Action**\n\n Based on poll results and community feedback in Discord and Commonwealth, we are asking to extend incentives on Osmosis with another 600k EVMOS over 90 days. Osmosis is the gateway for new users into the Cosmos ecosystem so it is important to maintain deep liquidity. Once this period is over, we can reevaluate the incentives as we will have a clearer picture with how native liquidity has grown.\n\n600k EVMOS over a 90 day period (6,666.67 EVMOS per day), 100 EVMOS for funding Osmosis gauge creation and filling.\n\nTOTAL : 600,100 EVMOS\n\n14 day bond only\n\nPool 722 (EVMOS/OSMO)\n\n **MULTISIG (3/4)**\n\n0xbAFE2Ae09c621462032BbC7FC997aA89c9780639\n\nbennylava - Evmos Community Manager/Evmos Governance Workstream\n\nTricky | Cosmos Spaces - Evmos Governance Workstream\n\nLPX - Evmos Governance Workstream\n\nJohnnyWyles - Osmosis Labs",

        "title": "Evmos Faucet for DeFi Kickoff",
        "description": "## Author\nGV | Swiss Staking ([@swiss_staking](https://twitter.com/swiss_staking))\n## Intro \nThe [Diffusion](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/64) incentives will start soon. As you might know, some incentivized pools require to bridge assets from Ethereum via Axelar/Gravity to Evmos. Once they are bridged to Evmos, you must convert them (on the [asset page](https://app.evmos.org/assets) of Evmos) from IBC-coins to ERC-20 tokens. This requires a fee of about ~0.3 Evmos. New ecosystem participants won’t own any Evmos at this time, so it is crucial to implement a faucet who funds them. This situation is only temporary, as the team will implement an auto-conversion on protocol level in the near future. Until then, it’s our job to onboard new participants with ease to unleash the full potential of the DeFi revival on Evmos.\n## Architecture \nThe bot will be available on the Discord faucet channel of Evmos. To minimize any gaming of the faucet we will implement a cooldown period, a minimum number of assets that must be deposited on the [asset page](https://app.evmos.org/assets) and further on-chain checks. The bot's wallet will be funded by the multisig on a bi-weekly basis (or if the balance gets close to zero).

For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\\n\\n## Impact\\n\\nThe purpose of this release is to return funds to the affected accounts during the claims records clawback of block 5074187. This process will be done through the upgrade handler. This will have to be a coordinated (breaking) upgrade since the state will be modified.\\n\\nThe list of affected accounts can be found at app/upgrades/v9_1/accounts.go with their respective balance. The scripts used to find affected accounts were made public at [claims_fixer's](https://github.com/evmos/claims_fixer) repo with detailed instructions on how to run them and reproduce the same result.\\n\\nNOTE: The return of funds to affected accounts is only relevant to Mainnet.\\n\\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v9.1.0).\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nThe Evmos core team created a End-to-End testing suite that perfoms the software upgrade locally. These tests have been performed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/ramacarlucho/evmos/blob/rama%2Fe2e_clean/tests/e2e/README.md).",

        "description": "**Summary**\n\nDystopia Labs is requesting $75k (60,000 EVMOS at time of writing) from the Evmos community to support 5 IRL events for $15k each, totaling to $75k in 2023:\n\n- ETH Portland (Jan 2023)\n- DeFi Denver (Feb 2023; right before ETH Denver)\n- ETH Austin (April 2023; right before Consensus)\n- ETH Seattle (July 2023)\n- ETH Vancouver (Aug 2023)\n\n**Abstract**\n\nWho Are We:\n\nDear Evmos Community,\nI'm Hsin-Ju, founder \u0026 CEO of Dystopia Labs [http://dystopialabs.com](http://dystopialabs.com). We host ETH events all around the world, including the upcoming ETH.Seattle, ETH Seoul, and DeFi Bogota. Since our inception in 2019, we’ve hosted 449+ workshops and 18 summits with reach in 19+ countries. With over 32,000+ registrants for our events, we’ve built strong crypto hubs in SF, LA, Austin, Portland, and brought in 345+ speakers from ETH Foundation, 0x, Curve, Aave, Osmosis, Sommelier, \u0026 more. TLDR; we have a strong developer community.\n\nWhy Our Proposal Matters:\n\nSince Evmos is an EVM compatible chain, there’s a huge opportunity for us to collaborate together to bring new developers and projects into the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nDystopia Labs would like to invite Evmos to speak at our upcoming 5 IRL events in 2023:\n\n• ETH Portland (Jan 2023)\n• DeFi Denver (Feb 2023; right before ETH Denver)\n• ETH Austin (April 2023; right before Consensus)\n• ETH Seattle (July 2023)\n• ETH Vancouver (Aug 2023)\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nWe are looking to ask the Evmos team for $15k support per event, totaling to $75k in 2023. This will help cover venue costs, AV, staging, furniture, and food.\nWe expect 300-350 attendees per event and about 800-1000 registrants (Evmos will get the email list). And like always, our events are 100% free to attendees so we’d love to have the Evmos community get involved and attend.\nTo us, a successful event would be oversubscribed, have fantastic speakers, and help bring more awareness and interest in the Evmos ecosystem.\nIn the past, we’ve had speakers like: Vitalik Buterin, Austin Griffith, the Flashbot’s team, Stani Kulechov, the CEO of Aave, the SEC Commissioner, and more. TLDR; you will be in good company at our events.\nOther sponsors include: UMA, 1inch Exchange, Figment, Rarible, and more.\n\n**WHY THE CONFERENCES ARE VALUABLE TO EVMOS:**\n\nBeyond brand recognition and on-site education, the email list is the highest value thing a sponsor can get out of any event. As part of our sponsorship agreement, Evmos would get the email list of all the conference attendees per event. This is a huge value add because the Evmos team can reach out to the attendees (who listened to the Evmos talk IRL) and drive them to more dense educational content (ie. like videos, blog posts, documentation, etc) after the event. They can even use these lists to even create their own event series (if they so wished). Over time, as they participate in more and more events, Evmos will be able to convert people who they met IRL into advocates (simply b/c they are able to reach attendees after the event and to continue pushing them down the funnel). TLDR; registrant lists will be a huge value add for the Evmos community.\n\nWe’re Part Of The Ecosystem:\nOur goal is to build a long-term relationship w/ the Evmos team / ecosystem and be a consistent contributor. We have also not sold ANY of the $EVMOS tokens that we've received. We're in it for the long haul :) In 2022, EVMOS participated in 2 of our events, HackSummit SF \u0026 DeFi Bogota. As a summary, here are the key stats for the 2 events Evmos participated in:\n\nFor DeFi Bogota: [(https://2022.defibogota.org/](https://2022.defibogota.org/)\n• 100% free for attendees\n• 2024 registrants (Evmos will get the email list)\n• ~700 attendees\n• 20 speakers\n• 21 sessions\n• 18 talks\n• 1 panel\n• 2 workshops\n• 7 hrs of content\n\nFor Hacksummit SF: [https://sf.hacksummit.org](https://sf.hacksummit.org/)\n• 100% free for attendees\n• 916 registrants (Evmos will get the email list)\n• ~350 attendees\n• 30 sessions\n• 24 talks\n• 1 panel\n• 5 workshops\n• 10 hrs of content",

        "description": "**Summary**\n\nThe Galxe team proposes allocating $400K USD in EVMOS to fund targeted campaigns and initiatives that provides Evmos with exposure to new users and drives organic growth on-chain. Leveraging our existing user base and previously successful campaigns, Galxe will guide users through the Evmos ecosystem to complete on and off-chain tasks and reward them with EVMOS tokens for doing so. These campaigns will involve partnerships with current Evmos dapps, and can expand to more other protocols as they launch on Evmos as well. With a large portion of the Rektdrop being clawed back, users who missed out have a chance to engage with the ecosystem. This will bring value to the Evmos community through expanding the user base, and providing outside users with direct exposure to Evmos and its native dapps.\n\n2/3 Multisig members:\nLPX - EvmosDAO\nGV | Swiss staking - EvmosDAO\nMat - Galxe Team\n\nMultisig address:\n0x0d5BCc86Feb4c26e17D672e57775Ae80C5597932\nDisclaimer: All funds will only be distributed to the participating Evmos community.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nGalxe is the leading Web3 credential data network in the world. A collaborative credential infrastructure enabling brands and developers to engage in communities and build robust products in Web3. Galxe’s infrastructure allows dApps to grow their community off chain and their protocol on chain through Galxe’s tools. Think of Galxe as a way to deploy on chain loyalty programs and customized growth marketing campaigns by distributing NFT badges. Up to this point, Galxe has over 11,100+ credentials contributed to its network, worked with over 1,200+ ecosystem partners, produced 8,000+ campaigns, and built up a community of 8.2M+ Galxe ID users. Credentials are a user’s footprint on or off the blockchain that represents their behaviors and actions taken (e.g., follow twitter, retweet, attend an AMA, swapping, staking, farming etc.)\n\nDiffusion, Orbital Apes, and SpaceFi have already agreed to be part of the Evmos Ecosystem Campaign on Galxe. The community can suggest other dapps that are live as well as future projects that launch on Evmos. Simple on-chain and off-chain tasks will be leveraged that will allow for high exposure and a low barrier of entry to the Evmos ecosystem. Potential tasks and credentials can include the following:\n\n● Following socials (Twitter/Discord)\n● Retweet/Quote Tweet a specific tweet\n● Make a swap\n● Provide liquidity\n● Buy an NFT and hold for X amount of time\n\nThe goal of this initiative is to drive off chain and on chain growth to the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n● Introduce the Galxe community of 8.2M+ active wallet addresses to the Evmos ecosystem\n● Introduce the broader crypto ecosystem to the Evmos ecosystem through Galxe’s tools and co-marketing power: Joint AMA’s, Blog post, Retweets, Quote Tweets, Tweets all throughout the campaign, Discord/Telegram communication, Campaign featured on our main carousel see: [https://galxe.com/campaigns](https://galxe.com/campaigns).\n● Engage users who aren’t currently in the ecosystem\n● Educate users on Evmos through learn to earn and participate to earn NFT campaigns\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nGalxe is requesting a rewards pool of $400k USD in Evmos that will go entirely to community members. We’re waiving integration fees for this type of campaign but want to make sure the participating community is incentivized and rewarded appropriately. Prior ecosystem campaigns have put forth rewards that have included token airdrop allocation and special governance rights. Solana put forth a rewards pool of $1M USD to participating users and Moonbeam allocated 1.5% of their token supply to this type of campaign. Funds will be handled and distributed by a multisig wallet controlled by the Evmos community throughout this entire process. The community members who take part in the engagements can expect to receive the funds after the campaign is over. The Evmos Community can decide how reward distribution will be handled. After the integration of Evmos into Galxe, any dApp in the Evmos ecosystem will be able to run growth campaigns on Evmos on Galxe for years to come.\n\n [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7622-evmos-ecosystem-campaign-by-galxe](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7622-evmos-ecosystem-campaign-by-galxe)",

        "description": "**Author:** LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n\n**Notice:** This proposal submission has been significantly shortened to fit within the proposal word count and accompanying graphical content has been removed - we highly recommend reading the full version on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md).\n\n**Abstract:** This proposal set is the continuation of the work which we committed to in the Evmos Interim Constitution, and draws inspiration from our ratified Guiding Values. Each proposal was carefully designed as they will each have long-term ripple effects on the DAO and Community as a whole. After a month of deliberation and productive discussions on Commonwealth, we feel confident to move forward.\n\nThe scope of this vote is to formalize ECP-1, which includes two submodules:\n- ECP-1A: Formalizing the Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n- ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (sub-DAO) and Compensation Framework\n---\nThe rest of the following proposals will be presented to the community very shortly:\n\n- ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Evmos DAO Governance Council\n- ECP-2B: Formalizing and Funding of the Community Mod \u0026 Support Workstream\n- ECP-3: Empowering the Community with Strategic Growth Initiatives*\n- ECP-4: The Establishment of the Evmos DAO Grants Program*\n---\n**ECP-2A will be submitted for voting later tonight, with ECP-2B to follow within the week.**\n**ECP-3 and ECP-4 will be finalized and proposed in Q1 2023, but the proposal drafts are available for preview on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussions/2.%20Evmos%20DAO%20Proposals) as well as [GitHub](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-3.md).**\n\n**Motivation:** The Evmos ecosystem — to be blunt — is in need of much more than liquidity incentives. While our strong governance processes and collaborative community culture have propelled us to the top of the Cosmos ecosystem in terms of governance participation, there are countless roles to be filled, infrastructure and public goods to build and fund, projects and initiatives in need of manpower, and the growing list of tasks at hand for the Evmos core team is becoming harder to manage.\n\nThe urgency to get our community more involved in the efforts of growing the Evmos ecosystem is increasing by the day, and systems must be put in place in which allows for the more efficient use of our resources. The power of networks and DAOs lies in the strength of the community — while all DAOs are different, this is a single common denominator that has held true for years.\n## ECP-1A: Evmos Community Proposal Framework\n**Summary**: This proposal seeks to formalize the adoption of the Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) framework. All community proposals must go through the proposal lifecycle as outlined in the framework before going on-chain for voting.\n\n**Abstract:** ECPs are standardized proposals subject to voting that (once enacted) regulate and define the behavior of the Evmos DAOs Governance system, and provides a funding mechanism for special projects and workstreams. The Evmos Community Proposal (ECP) Framework sets the guideline for all subsequent ECPs to follow. This ECP is the foundational ECP that provides the necessary templates, processes, and guidelines for working within the framework and defines the key roles required for the operation and enforcement of the ECP process.\n## ECP Framework Components\n### 1.

ECP Submission Guidelines\nPlease refer to [Full Proposal \u003e](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md)\n---\n## ECP-1B: Formalizing the Workstream (subDAO) and Compensation Framework \n\n**Summary:** Workstreams, also known as subDAOs, guilds, committees, etc., are long-term projects with distinct, high-level objectives that are aligned with the main DAO. Coordination at scale requires a distributed organization — and distributed organizations require a certain level of coordination and set expectations to work together effectively.\n\n**Abstract:** Workstreams and subDAOs are key in scaling a DAO and are crucial in grassroots community growth. The Workstream Framework introduces a fractalized blueprint of subDAOs and teams, the incentive alignment mechanics, funding and formation processes, and expectations. One of the core guiding values in our Constitution is the *Sovereignty to Work*. Every team, workstream, subDAO — whatever title they wish to be called by — will be unique in how they operate. Please refer to full proposal for our vision for workstreams.\n### 1. Definition and Purpose \nWorkstreams are typically DAO-funded teams with a recurring budget with no termination date (i.e., Community Moderation \u0026 Support, Marketing \u0026 Creative Services, etc). A workstream is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Evmos [Constitutional Values](https://gov.evmos.community/constitution#3-guiding-principles-and-values) and community run initiatives.\n### 2. Workstream Requirements \nAnyone may start a workstream and gather momentum behind it by posting on Commonwealth. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made, this workstream is considered informal. A workstream can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but workstream proposals must satisfy the various creation.\n### 3. Workstream Formation Process\n### 4. Workstream Stages\n\n## The Standardized Compensation Framework\nOur goal is to scale the Evmos DAO by attracting and retaining great contributors and leaders.\n**Compensation Principles, Compensation Types, Compensation Eligibility** can be found in the full document.\n\nWhen a workstream makes a formal funding request the list of team member roles must include:\n- The role the contributor plays\n- The weekly time commitment \n- The monthly compensation amount \n- Compensation rationale (base and vested) \n\nCommunity ownership of a project rests on transparency, and transparency rests on legitimacy. Salary will be transparent to all DAO contributors, through a standardized base compensation framework for all current and future workstream members. This framework also aims to increase equity between workstreams as well as between network stakeholders \u0026 the DAO. \n\n## Base Compensation\n**Base Compensation Parameters**\n\n**1 | Value Level** - refers to the contributors expected value created during the compensation cycle on a scale of 1 to 3. While measuring the value of a contributor is challenging and subjective, the following matrix will hopefully assist in the assignment of each contributors level. Value Level Assessment Matrix - Please refer to the full proposal.\n\n**2 | Commitment Level** - The DAO will cap time full-time commitments to 40 hour work weeks for a total of 160 hours / month. Extra commitments are not officially recognized by the base compensation framework - this responsibility will be given to the Evmos Community and workstream leaders.\n\nCommitment Levels are expressed as percentages, with 100% representing A) a full-time commitment and B) the sole prioritization and focus on the duties assigned by the respective workstreams of Evmos DAO. Part B of the Commitment Level is self-assessed, and each contributor shall publicly declare their prioritization levels (i.e. secondary job commitments, contributing to multiple workstreams, contributing to other DAOs or chains, etc.)\n\nExample scenarios: refer to the full proposal.\n\n**3 | Base Rate** - The base rate is currently proposed at $28/hr. The Community may vote to adjust the hourly rate through a governance proposal to account for changes in market conditions and/or treasury reserve levels. \n\n**Calculating Base Compensation**:\n `Monthly Compensation = ($28/hr base * Value Level) * (160 hours * Commitment Level)`\n## Vesting Compensation\n**Vesting Compensation Parameters**\n\n**1 | Contribution Level** - Every workstream and subDAO should be working on a 6-month funding cycle. Workstream leaders are required to provide the Community a progress report every cycle and is responsible for keeping all contributors accountable in their work and their commitment. The Evmos Community, including the Governance Council, is expected to keep workstream leaders accountable in management of their teams (including off-chain governance proposals for removal and replacement of contributors).\n\nThe Contribution Level will be a point-based system in which all workstream members must earn; thus the beginning points for all members should start at 0. For each funding cycle that passes, the Contribution Levels should rise in proportion to the Commitment Level from Base Compensations for all contributors that are still contributing as active members.\n\nRefer to full prop for more details.\n\n**2 | Accountability Level** - With greater responsibilities comes even greater accountability. Accountability is calculated on a scale from 1 to 2. \n\nPlease refer to the full proposal to view the accountability level table.\n\n**Calculating Vesting Compensation**:\n`Vesting = Yearly Base Compensation * Contribution Level * Accountability Level`\n\nVesting schedules for all contracts are 4-years.\n\n[Full Proposal \u003e](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md)"

        "description": "My real name is Loredana Cirstea. I have been volunteering for more than 100h/week for Evmos, Ethermint, and blockchain technologies. For the core Evmos I have implemented the fee split module (renamed to revenue), global minimum gas limit, first to prototype and demo working, innovative precompiles for having access to IBC, Cosmos SDK, IPFS, IPLD, etc. from inside the EVM. More information [here](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/tree/master/evmos). My work is proven by [GitHub](https://github.com/loredanacirstea) and [my technical demo videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/LoredanaCirstea/videos). I am an early investor in Evmos, representing a volunteer organization. And I manage the evmos4volunteers validator.\n\nI invested all my energy and skills to make Evmos better and showing others what it can do, since February 2022.\n\n## An Independent Evmos Chain\n\nI want to see Evmos DAO as a body that fully implements the independence of Evmos:\n- the Evmos Community cannot be rug pulled by unknown dues from just a couple of actors.\n- the investors of Evmos (those who brought value and raised the price of Evmos for everyone's benefit) and the contributors of effort to Evmos have a strong say in the governance of Evmos \n- the Evmos DAO does not have hidden influences from any 3rd party\n- the Evmos DAO is subservient to the Evmos Chain\n- the Evmos DAO bodies have a mechanism of checks and balances that will disincentivize corrupt practices\n\n## The ECP-x Proposals - Issues\n\nLooking at proposal https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83 and [the subsequent proposals in plan](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussions/2.%20Evmos%20DAO%20Proposals) by the same group (led by LPX, Bennylava, GV), the issues are:\n- the authors baked their names in the formation of the organization\n- all operations of their organization have not been public\n- they started filling out roles before the organization was ratified on-chain\n- they dismissed other competing ideas for Evmos DAO that were already presented\n- they don't accept improvements to their text if you tell them what is wrong\n- they already have bigger powers in the Evmos Discord than any other validator or investor, even in their unofficial capacity, and they can focus the attention of voters and validators on topics that they want\n- their real identities are not known to the Evmos Community\n- they have no supervisor to hold them accountable. The Evmos Community cannot do that, because their operations are not public\n- I have been contributing as a volunteer to Evmos from before its genesis but I (nor others who contributed to Evmos governance) was not invited by this group to join this governance workstream. So, it is not merit that earns you a position in their governance workstream.\n- their relationship with Tharsis and Evmos Foundation is unclear. If they have formed this group and given them the above powers, then there is no Evmos Community in the Evmos DAO, and between the voting power of the core team, VC validators, foundation delegations promises, a controlled governance process, there is no chain independence.\n- their texts for Evmos DAO are very long, lack substance, and are evasive. Formation texts need to be precise.\n- the erosion of Governance (as we know it in Cosmos):\n    - [ECP-2A]/Projects and Initiatives (Ongoing \u0026 Planned)/B. Off-Chain Community Governance (In Progress) has conflicts of control: what happens when the Cosmos side votes YES on a proposal and the EVM side votes NO on the same proposal? (These types of problems have been solved by my quasar solution.)\n    - [ECP-3] talks about $GOV as governance token. It is unclear from the document what role this has in the actual Governance process. This is intentionally evasive. \n\n\n## Solutions: An Honest DAO\n\n1. Read the alternative texts: [A Vision for Evmos: Proven Independency](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7846-a-vision-for-evmos-proven-independency)\n2. Decide how to vote: either vote YES to proposal #83 and their other ECP-x proposals or vote NO and wait for the above alternative to be proposed on-chain.\n\n- my alternative Evmos DAO does not propose anybody in any official position\n- subsequent proposals will prove and guarantee Evmos chain independence from past dues and any occult forces but lay out in the open the deserved influence that Evmos founders and important proven contributors should have\n- I will not ask for retroactive pay for my services, like the authors of #83 plan. Nor should the chain accept to pay for services that were not solicited. My proposal for this: [Common Sense Setting: No Payment For Unsolicited Services](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7850-common-sense-setting-no-payment-for-unsolicited-services)\n- the quasar technology (cosmos sdk \u003c-\u003e EVM communication) that I invented (and demoed) will be able to bring flexible governance on-chain, to the token holders. Such as the ability to choose one option from many and add new options during voting, or continuous voting. E.g. the chain directly and continuously decides on Evmos DAO bodies, offices, and their members.\n\n## Discussion\n\n- [A Vision for Evmos: Proven Independency](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7846-a-vision-for-evmos-proven-independency)\n- [Common Sense Setting: No Payment For Unsolicited Services](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7850-common-sense-setting-no-payment-for-unsolicited-services)\n- [Evmos DAO creation discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7782-evmos-dao-creation-discussion)\n- [Repayment of effort for Informal Evmos Governance Workstream](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/7841-repayment-of-effort-for-informal-evmos-governance-workstream)\n\n## How to vote on this proposal\n\nFirst, I apologize for putting this as an urgent proposal, without prior discussion (even though my listed commonwealth proposals \u0026 criticism have much more than the required 3 days of pre-chain discussions). I was forced by circumstance: proposal #83 being put on-chain before chain independence of dues has been achieved.\n\nThis proposal is for bringing the dialogue on-chain when the dialogue off-chain is evaded.\n\nWe let the Evmos Community know that there are alternatives to the present Evmos DAO proposals. If you want to keep the Evmos chain independent and decentralized, you want to know them before voting on #83.\n\nVox Catenae Vox Dei.\n"

        "description": "## Authors\n\n - LPX, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n - GV, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n - Benny Lava, Evmos DAO Governance Council\n## Summary\n[ECP-2A](https://evmos.community/ECP/2A.html) is the follow-up proposal of [ECP-1](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-1.md), which set the foundational layer for Evmos DAO Governance ([Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83)).\n\nOperating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO (Proposal #51), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past six months. We are officially requesting formalization by funding.\n### Important Notice\n\nThis post has been modified to fit within the maximum allowed character count.\n\n- [Governance Council Litepaper](https://evmos.community/litepaper)\n- [ECP-2A - Full Proposal (GitHub)](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/ECP-2A.md)\n- [ECP-2A - Full Proposal (HTML)](https://evmos.community/ECP/2A.html)\n## Abstract\n### Foreword\nThe overwhelming community support and the shared beliefs in our vision have been truly inspiring. The support shown by the community is not taken for granted - our pledge for progressive decentralization is at the core of everything we do, and we are committed to working to build a stronger, brighter ecosystem for Evmos. For those that want to deep-dive into the philosophical reasoning behind our proposal, [a prologue has been published (warning: long read).](https://mirror.xyz/evmosdao.eth/rSZyD_MAO4zkA46lvqi-f9P5YfVBrnMsU3TShBWK-sY)\n### The Governance Council\nThe Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.\n\nThe Governance Council's wide array of achievements and community work for the past half-year are listed in the *Progress Report* section of ECP-2A.\n\nWe also want to emphasize that we are not trying to hold on to power or exert control over the ecosystem. We expect to be scrutinized every funding cycle, and even replaced if needed. Our goal is to accelerate the development of the decentralized ecosystem, and to create a future in which power is distributed back to the Evmos Community.\nGet familiarized with our short to mid-term initiatives with through the [Governance Council Litepaper](https://evmos.community/litepaper).\n## Funding Request\nWe recognize the current market conditions and its volatility, while unfortunate, we must continue to push forward. We have pegged the price of Evmos to $0.50 for this Funding Cycle (6-months).\n\n- **A. Contributor Compensations:** 1,233,668 EVMOS\n- **B. Research \u0026 Development Fund:** 975,000 EVMOS\n- **C. Ecosystem Bootstrap Fund:** 975,000 EVMOS\n- **D. Treasury Diversification \u0026 Future WS Comps:** 1,560,000 EVMOS\n- **Total:** 4,743,668 EVMOS (~790,611 EVMOS / month, ~4.2% of CommunityPool)\n\nWe are currently in talks with a few Ethereum-based DAOs that are looking to diversify their revenue streams via a token-for-stable swap. This allows for the diversification of our treasury and the extension of our operational runway without creating sell-pressure of EVMOS in the open market.\n\nA more detailed itemized list of requested funds can be found in the full proposal as well as the the Litepaper.\n### Fund Disbursements\nThis funding proposal will kick off the \"DAO Treasury - Phase 1\" which is managed by 3 Council Members and 3 Active Validators in a 4-6 Gnosis Safe configuration. All treasury spending is publicly available for viewing with full transparency.\n\n**Fund Signatories**:\n\n- Tam | TC Network\n- CO | Orbital Apes\n- Rok | Qubelabs\n- Benny | Governance\n- LPX | Governance\n- GV | Governance\n\n**Safe Deployment Address**: [0xD79ff7FBeAA462b7b8Ab6368A2F3a253F7d94223](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0xD79ff7FBeAA462b7b8Ab6368A2F3a253F7d94223)\n(evmos1670l07l2533t0w9tvd529uaz20majs3rf57zgz)\n\n**DAO Treasury - Phase 2** will be implemented when ready.

Everything built was from the $70k savings combined from the team. \n **Short threads to understand our whole operation** -\u003e [here](https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1605612305542045696) \n **For further clarity, please see discussion on [commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8437-funding-request-metatank)** \n \n **Short Intro:** \n MetaTank is creating a gameverse (think MCU but for games) around its IP. Focusing on building web2 mobile games (hypercasual genre) and connecting them to web3 via our Conversion Platform. Lore-based games that are stream-friendly (prone to virality) and fun. Users can simply download our games from an app store and play. However, the option exists for users to convert their in-game rewards into on-chain $MTNK tokens on the Evmos blockchain.\n **Important:** We are not a Metaverse, no NFTs are involved, no tokens required to play, and we are not P2E. MetaTank is creating games that are price-independent. Focusing on strategically increasing our IP value through the mass appeal of hypercasual mobile games.\n **Why we are unique:** We are bringing a new method of revenue generation and user acquisition not seen in crypto. Built on quality production and not reliant on marketing hype, token prices or a constant funnel of new users (new capital).\n **Business Model:** MetaTank generates fiat revenue externally via In-App Ads and In-App Purchases. A portion is injected into Evmos to balance the rewards liquidity pool. The remainder is reinvested into game development. Further adding to our library of mobile games which leads to more users and increased recurring revenues.\n **Bringing Value to Evmos:** MetaTank has found a less-exhausting method to onboard web2 users. Only via Evmos can the Conversion Platform be utilized. Users will become natives and have a stake in Evmos’ growth.  They will be holding a portion of their wealth on Evmos. They will support local projects and engage in other activities such as trading, minting, liquidity mining and lending. Long-term stakeholders who will not disappear after a retweet competition or incentive program.\n \n **Initial benefits to Evmos include:** \n - Benefit 1 – Liquidity injected into Evmos from revenues generated externally (Ads/In-app purchases).\n - Benefit 2 – Onboarding web2 users, who must enter Evmos to use our Conversion Platform.\n - Benefit 3 - Onboarding Web2 game developers with already established userbases and IP (compounding Benefit 1 \u0026 2).\n - Benefit 4 – 10% of MetaTank tokens are reserved for the Evmos community.\n - Benefit 5 – Conducting the MetaTank amassed userbase as a marketing platform, promoting Evmos and its ecosystem projects. \n \n This is not a one-time deal. MetaTank wishes to continue its relationship with the Evmos community, sharing in the value generated by its IP. Our materials prove that we are capable and have already built a version of everything we propose.\n **[Proof of capability \u003e](https://twitter.com/MetaTankProject/status/1605249619713490944)** \n The mobile gaming industry is experiencing non-stop growth. We can do a lot more with Evmos and show the world of web2 and web3 that there is another way to gaming in crypto.",

        "description": "## The Natural Language for the Governance of the Evmos Chain is English\n\nDiscussion: [https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8551-governance-consensus-the-governance-language-is-english](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8551-governance-consensus-the-governance-language-is-english)\n\n### Purpose\n\nClarify the parameters for the natural language used in Evmos Governance.\n\n### Exposition\n\nTo achieve authority of Governance, the chain needs to establish the most accessible ground for debate and voting. The language for the process of Governance is one of the main parameters and we consider that the best language for Evmos Governance is the English language.\n\nSince the meaning of the sentence and therefore paragraph can be changed by choice of word meaning, by the punctuation signs, and by the resultant syntax tree, a consensus has to be reached on the unique arbiter for each, including the syntax tree of a proposal (in whole or in part).\n\n### Rules\n\n1. The accepted English dictionary for words and concepts and their semantic linking shall be the latest version of The Princeton Wordnet. [http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/](http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/) with language option: English (eng). \n    \n    The alternatives, in order (in their order of use when a source is unavailable):\n    * 1.1. [http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/](http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/)\n    * 1.2. [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn)\n    * 1.3. https://en-word.net/(https://en-word.net/)\n\n2. Any governance text may contain words with subscript that indicates the order of sense of the word as it appears in WordNet. For example:\n\u003e The chair\u003csub\u003e3\u003c/sub\u003e position is the most important.\n\nrefers to the third meaning of the word 'chair' from [http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/entity/eng/chair](http://www.lexvo.org/uwn/entity/eng/chair) : _(noun) the officer who presides at the meetings of an organization; 'address your remarks to the chairperson' chairman, chairwoman, chairperson, president, chair_\n\n3. If concepts are not found in the source designated by point (1): Wikipedia may be used. [https://en.wikipedia.org/](https://en.wikipedia.org/)\n\n4. The syntax tree source shall be [http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/) with its English option. \n\n     The alternatives, in order: \n     * 4.1. [http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/](http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/)\n     * 4.2. [https://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/submit-sentence-4.html](https://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/submit-sentence-4.html)\n\n### Meaning of the Decision\n\n- if this proposal passes: the governance process gains additional legitimacy by recognizing prior consensus contained in the gov language itself\n\n- if this proposal does not pass: the token holders forfeit the right to reject a proposal (on-chain or off-chain) on account of not being made using proper, verifiable English\n\n#### Additional Benefits of Adopting\nThe subsequent proposals (on and off-chain) may be legitimately challenged on:\n\n- the natural language used\n- clarifying the meaning of a specific word\n- sources of truth (such as a unique dictionary)\n- syntax or semantic ambiguities\n\nOnly the chains that will pass proposals compatible with this one will have the legitimacy to enter common governance platforms for the InterChain. By this prop, we offered Evmos the opportunity to be the early leader in that respect.\n\n### Author\n\nChristian Tzurcanu, volunteer for The Laurel Project.

        "description": "## Description\\n\\n### Author\\n\\nDaniel Burckhardt, Evmos Core Team\\n\\n### Software upgrade being scheduled with this proposal\\n\\nIf successful, this proposal will schedule an Evmos Mainnet software upgrade at block height [9,495,000](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/blocks/9495000) from its current version [v9.1.0](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v9.1.0) to [v10.0.0](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v10.0.0). This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\\n\\n### Motivation\\n\\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process, that is first proposed on Testnet and then on Mainnet. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\\n\\n### Impact\\n\\nOn a high level, the v10.0.0 software includes the following improvements:\\n\\n- Update Cosmos-SDK to v0.46.7, IBC-Go to v5.2.0 and Ethermint to v0.20.0\\n- Automatic conversion of IBC coins to their ERC20 representation upon receiving\\n- Support for ERC20 token transfers via IBC\\n- ERC20 proposals to register ERC20 tokens and Cosmos coins now can receive multiple denominations\\n- Prioritized mempool support for Cosmos and Ethereum txs\\n- EIP-1559 support for native Cosmos transactions\\n- EIP-712 fixes for all major Cosmos messages (eg: MsgGrant for restake support)\\n- Add Ledger support to the evmosd CLI\\n- Ethereum Tx indexer\\n- The funder for a clawback vesting account can now be updated\\n- Introduce minimum commission rate as governance ruled parameter for the staking module (set at 5%)\\n- EIP-712 fixes for the vesting module\\n- Add a default file store listener for a basic implementation of [ADR-038: State Listening](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/architecture/adr-038-state-listening)\\n- Update default node snapshot interval to 5000 seconds\\n- Update Ledger supported algorithms to only consist of EthSecp256k1\\n\\nA full change log can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v10.0.0).\\n\\nNOTE: Since Cosmos v0.46 it is not possible to include links to Windows binaries in software upgrade proposals anymore.\\n\\n### Testing\\n\\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/main/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade has been manually performed on a local node.\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8501-evmos-software-upgrade-v10).",

Then Tharsis extracted tens of millions of dollars from the apparent value of the Evmos chain to pay themselves again.\n\nThe Laurel Project which volunteered for Tharsis for developing a good portion of the Evmos chain tech and some Ethermint coding will also ask the Evmos Community if their efforts will be accepted in perpetuity as volunteering or if they will be paid as retroactive public goods funding.\n\n## The Public Goods Created\n\n* 22 Feb - 21 March 2022: ~359.5h\n* Detailed list: [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/5a6aa821f7c22515b557f443c63de081e8a5700f/evmos/2.%20March_2022.md](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/blob/5a6aa821f7c22515b557f443c63de081e8a5700f/evmos/2.%20March_2022.md)\n\n\n## Proofs\n\n* 1. The proof that the output of the effort exists as a public good: the videos exist and are public on YouTube, and the code exists and is public.\n* 2. The proof that it is about the Evmos chain/tech: the code is used by Ethermint/Evmos.\n* 3. The proof that the effort is of the quality and quantity claimed: Federico Kunze signed the confirmations for the effort, as a comment on [https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/2](https://github.com/loredanacirstea/CV/issues/2). The exact text was:\n\u003e I confirm and acknowledge the stated output. Thanks @loredanacirstea! 💯\n\u003e Federico Kunze Küllmer - CEO Tharsis Labs / Co-Founder Evmos\n\u003e Fri, Mar 25, 2022, by [@fedekunze](https://github.com/fedekunze)\n\nbut he recently deleted that comment (he deleted all his public confirmations of my volunteering).\n* 4. The proof that this chain accepts claims for retroactive public goods is [proposal 88](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88).\n\n## Retroactive Payment\n\n* 359.5h * 255 EUR/h = 91,672.5 EUR\n* current price: 0.265110 EUR/ $EVMOS\n\nTotal: 345,790 $EVMOS\n\n## The Meaning of the Decision\n\n* 1. If this proposal passes: the Evmos chain pays retroactively for this public good.\n* 2. If this proposal does not pass: the Evmos chain recognizes in perpetuity this public good as a volunteering effort of The Laurel Project in the interest of the Evmos Community. (or is bound to produce counter-proofs to the ones above). The presented effort was made with the intent of being offered to the Evmos Community as a volunteer effort. The legitimate repayment for volunteer effort is the recognition of said effort. \n* 3. No with veto: the chain benefits from and uses this free, unpaid effort, but it has decided to punish the author of this effort, for requesting formal recognition of the volunteered effort.\n\n## Receiver Address\n\nevmos1k9pw7ht4kp7td5450sdrkj2tmly3ug59ddhadn\n\n\n## Author\n\nLoredana Cirstea, volunteer for The Laurel Project.\n\n",

        "description": "## Increase Deposit Amount for Evmos Governance \n  ### Summary \n \n  This passing of this proposal would raise the minimum amount of EVMOS tokens to be deposited for a proposal to reach on-chain voting from 192 EVMOS to 3500 EVMOS with the intentions to maintain high quality proposals and prevent spam from going on chain.\n \n ### Abstract\n \n  Proposal Deposit Concept: \n  \n * For governance proposals to enter voting, a proposal must be reach a set deposit of an amount defined by parameters in the governance module before the deposit end time.\n \n  * A proposal minimum deposit can be contributed to and submitted by multiple different accounts, not just a single, and it does not have to be fully submitted by the proposer account.\n  The proposer account is only required to deposit ~**1 EVMOS**. \n \n  Deposit Refund and Burn Concept: \n \n  * If the proposal is approved or rejected but not vetoed, each deposit will be automatically refunded to its respective depositor, transferred from the governance ModuleAccount. \n \n  * If the proposal is vetoed with greater than 1/3 (33.4%) of voting power, deposit(s) will be burned from the governance ModuleAccount and the proposal information along with its deposit information will be removed from state.\n \n  ### Motivation \n \n  Proposal to Increase Deposit Amount: \n \n  By the time of writing and at the current token price value, the minimum deposit requires 192 EVMOS or approximately 60 in USD equivalent. Currently, is a low threshold to help ensure quality proposals and prevent possible spam proposals. Comparing other cosmos governance current deposits, the Cosmos hub requires 250 ATOM or 2,280 USD and Osmosis requires 1600 OSMO or 1,193 USD for proposals to enter the on-chain voting stage. \n \n  With the passing of this proposal, the minimum deposit will be increased to 3500 EVMOS or approximately 1,100 in USD equivalent. This change will not be permanent and can be changed again later via governance. \n \n  ### Important Note: \n \n  Community Members must not be priced out of making proposals on chain. 3500 EVMOS is likely a large enough deposit to deter spam, whilst still being within the reach of most community members to campaign for a deposit, or provide one themselves. \n \n  Multiple wallets may fund any proposal deposit, so this remains within the realm of most Cosmos users to campaign for and crowdsource funding from other community members and validators, where a good proposal may exist, but funding for a deposit is lacking. \n \n  ### Voting \n \n  * By voting YES, you agree that the minimum deposit for a proposal to enter the voting period should be increased from 192 EVMOS to 3500 EVMOS. \n \n  * By voting NO, you disagree in part or in entirety with one or more of the above statements. \n \n  * By voting ABSTAIN, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal. \n \n  * By voting NOWITHVETO, expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.",

        "description": "## Ratify Governance-Official Meanings for Yes, No, Abstain and NoWithVeto \n \n ### Summary \n \n This proposal aims to put forward a clear definition for the voting options “Yes”, “No”, “Abstain”, and “NoWithVeto” in Evmos governance that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community. These definitions are taken directly from the Evmos docs, and will be further formalized if this proposal passes.  \n \n * Yes: indicates approval of the proposal in its current form. \n * No: indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form. \n * Abstain: indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal. \n* NoWithVeto: indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned. \n \n### Abstract \n \n Recently, there have been proposals that have attempted to redefine the meanings of the voting options in a governance process. This is a dangerous precedent to set because it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among voters, which can in turn undermine the will of the voters. To ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the views of the community, it is crucial to clearly define the meanings of the voting options and design the governance process in a way that promotes fairness and effectiveness. \n \n### Motivation \n \nIn Evmos governance a “No” vote is generally understood to mean that the voter is opposed to the proposal and does not want it to be implemented. An “Abstain” vote means that the voter is neutral on the proposal and does not wish to express a position either for or against it. A “No With Veto” vote means the voter is strongly opposed and in most cases will lead to the proposal deposit being burned. \n \n It can be dangerous to add or change meanings to the voting options in a governance process because it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among voters. Additionally, changing meanings to the voting options can undermine the transparency and fairness of the governance process. If voters do not understand the full implications of their votes, they may make decisions that are not in line with their true views or the best interests of the community. This can undermine the legitimacy of the governance process and lead to mistrust and dissatisfaction among the community. \n \nOverall, it is important to clearly define the meanings of the various voting options in a governance process to ensure that voters can make informed decisions and that the results of the vote accurately reflect the will of the community. \n \nThe passage of this proposal will ratify following definitions directly from the Evmos docs that are simple for voters to understand and do not undermine the will of the community: \n \n* Yes: indicates approval of the proposal in its current form. \n* No: indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form. \n* Abstain: indicates that the voter is impartial to the outcome of the proposal. \n* NoWithVeto: indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned. \n \n ### Voting \n \n* By voting YES, indicates approval of the proposal in its current form to ratify the governance-official meanings of  “Yes”,“No”, “Abstain” and “No With Veto” for governance voting options. \n \n* By voting NO,  indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form. \n \n* By voting ABSTAIN, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal. \n \n* By voting NOWITHVETO, indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned. \n"

        "description": "### Parameters being changed with this proposal.\\n\\nIf successful, this proposal will increase the developer_shares parameter in the revenue module from 50% to 95%. The remainder 5% is to prevent spam.\\n\\n### Motivation\\n\\n The `x/revenue` module enables Evmos to support splitting transaction fees between validators/delegators and smart contract developers. As a part of the [Evmos Token Model](https://medium.com/evmos/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b), this mechanism aims to increase the adoption of Evmos by offering a new stable source of income for smart contract developers. Developers can register their smart contracts and every time someone interacts with a registered smart contract, the contract deployer account or their assigned withdrawal account receives a part of the transaction fees. The **developer_shares** parameter is the percentage of the transaction fees that are sent to the contract deployer.\\n\\nConsidering the low transaction costs on Evmos the current 50/50 split of EVM tx fees between smart contract developers and validators is insufficient to provide meaningful cash flows for dev teams. An increase to 95% would create more incentives for developers to deploy and register smart contracts on Evmos.\\n\\nWe acknowledge the fact that this change alone might not be significant to sustain developer teams in the short term and are exploring additional alternatives to continue incentivizing teams to build on Evmos in the mid-term.\\n\\nIf this proposal passes validators and delegators will earn zero fees for EVM transactions with registered contracts, but will still earn the [commission on staking rewards](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/validators/validator-faq.html#what-is-the-incentive-to-run-a-validator) and 95% of the fees from other Cosmos transactions (eg: IBC, Staking, etc).\\n\\nOur goal with this proposal is to attract and retain smart contract developers as they are the backbone of the Evmos ecosystem and to provide a means to generate sustainable revenue for projects.### Impact\\n\\nRegistered smart contracts will receive 95% of the EVM transaction fees if this proposal passes.\\n\\nBelow are some calculations that might give a clearer example of what developers can expect:\\n - At current Evmos price ($0.40637) and minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 200,000 transactions with a smart contract: **$0.00466466 * 200000 txs * 0.95 = $886.29**\\n - At Evmos price ($2) and minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 100,000 transactions with a smart contract: **$0.01669652 * 100000 txs * 0.95 = $1,586.17**\\n - At optimistic Evmos price ($4.50) minGasPrice (20000000000aevmos) for 50,000 transactions with a smart contract: **$0.03756717 * 50000 txs * 0.95 = $1,784.43**\\n\\n Gas price calculations were generated with [this](https://observablehq.com/@loredanacirstea/evm-gas-prices) calculator. Developers can change the variables to estimate how much revenue their dApps can generate.\\n\\n### Discussion\\n\\nBefore voting, please follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8536-revenue-module-change-revenue-to-95)",

        "description": "# Cancellation of Prop 45, Clarification of Laurel Project Role\\n\\nThis proposal seeks a formal cancellation of Proposal 45, return of funds from the Prop 45 multisig to the Community Pool and a clarification of the role of Loredana and Christian on EVMOS due to recent malicious acts and spam proposals.\\n\\nThis proposal is unfortunately necessary to submit anonymously, due to Loredana and Christian\\'s legal threats, which were committed to Github two weeks ago: [https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/EffortEvaluation.md](https://github.com/the-laurel/chain-proposals/blob/main/evmos/EffortEvaluation.md)\\n\\nAs such it is important to clarify that this proposal is not being made by the EVMOS Foundation or any of it\\'s representatives, and is being brought forth by a community stakeholder of the EVMOS chain who has been witnessing these events unfold. It is my hope that this proposal can bring closure to this governance module spam.\\n\\n### Clarification of Laurel Project / InterChain Pact Failed Proposals\\n\\nMany of the recent proposals made by Loredana or Christian seek to interject meaning into what happens if a proposal is rejected - with language such as, \"_if this proposal does not pass: the chain signals its disregard for the laws of the land and eventual premeditation to break the Criminal Law_\".\\n\\nThis proposal therefore seeks to very specifically and pointedly clarify that none of the proposals made by Loredana or Christian which failed to pass have any meaning other than the standard meaning a proposal failure within the typical meaning of the Cosmos SDK: __The Community felt the proposal should not pass, and therefore it has failed. This includes No and NoWithVeto.__\\n\\n### Previous Behavior\\nThis appears to be a pattern of behavior that goes back to their earlier days on Ethereum as well, as can be seen here:\\n\\n**Harassment of Ethereum developers, circa July 2021:**\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ocv773/ethereum_and_billionaires_stealing_ideas_from/\\n\\n\\n**Spam Proposals and Misbehavior on EVMOS:**\\n\\n[#84: The Alternative: An Honest DAO and an Independent Evmos Chain](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/84) (Front-running Proposal 86)\\n\\n[#86: Common Sense Setting: No Payment For Unsolicited Services](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/88) (Further governance interference on Prop 86)\\n\\n[#93: Governance Consensus: The Governance Language is English](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/93) (A solution in search of a problem, no point to this proposal)\\n\\n[#95: Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for March 2022)](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/95) (A retroactive funding effort which seeks recognition for volunteer efforts through proposal rejection - they voted no themselves after proposing)\\n\\n[#98: Governance Consensus: Only Elected Officers May Represent the Will of the Chain](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/98) (Centralization effort to codify elected officers)\\n\\n[#99: Governance Consensus: No Criminal Decisions](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/99) (Implies a rejection of the proposal is an endorsement of criminal behavior)\\n\\n[#100: Retroactive Payment for Public Goods (Evmos Development for 2022)](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/100) (Re-spam of previously rejected proposal 95, includes even worse language around \"what NoWithVeto\" means)\\n\\n[#105: Governance Consensus: Governance Immunity](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/105) (Further manipulation of what yes and no votes mean on a proposal)\\n\\n[#106: Consensus Test](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/106) (This proposal is a spam proposal which is asking if 1+1=2)\\n\\n[#106\\n[Kava Reddit Thread regarding Ethermint Funding](https://www.reddit.com/r/kava_platform/comments/xyxr1o/prevotelast_version_ethermint_funding_proposal) (Socially unacceptable behavior interacting with the Kava Community)\\n\\n### Cancellation of Prop 45 and Clarifications of Laurel Project Role\\n\\n**Loredana (evmos4volunteers, The Laurel Project)** proposed that the EVMOS Community pay for lobbying efforts by subsidizing an apartment in Berlin. It has become clear that this volunteer effort is more of a personal mission than an effort to assist in the furtherance of the chain.\\n\\n**Christian Tzurcanu (votes4volunteers, The Laurel Project)** has assisted in many of these spam proposals as well, and has actively engaged in socially unacceptable governance behavior when interacting with the community and validator set, particularly within Commonwealth Discussions, Reddit and the EVMOS Community Discord.\\n\\n**As such this proposal seeks to clarify through social consensus the following points:**\\n\\n1) Loredana Cirstea does not operate in an official capacity for the EVMOS chain.\\n\\n2) Christian Tzurcanu does not operate in an official capacity for the EVMOS chain.\\n\\n3) The Laurel Project and The InterChain Pact are not officially associated in any way with the EVMOS chain, nor should either of them conduct work on the behalf of the EVMOS chain.\\n\\n4) Proposal 45 should be cancelled and remaining funds returned to the Community Pool.\\n\\n5) All language contained within the rejected Proposals 84, 88, 93, 95, 98, 99, 100, 105 and 106 are completely nullified.

        "title": "New Evmos Liquidity Incentive and SpaceFi Whole Launching",
        "description": "This proposal is to introduce Evmos Liquidity Incentive to [spacefi.io](https://spacefi.io/) and help Evmos liquidity and ecosystem to grow further through the launch of SpaceFi’s entire products suite (DEX+NFT+Spacebase+Launchpad) as well as the SPACE token.\n\nFinal Proposal: [[Pre-Vote] New Evmos Liquidity Incentive and SpaceFi whole launching](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8918-prevote-new-evmos-liquidity-incentive-and-spacefi-whole-launching)\n\nFull Discussion: [[IDEATION] New Evmos Liquidity Incentive and SpaceFi whole launching](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8598-ideation-new-evmos-liquidity-incentive-and-spacefi-whole-launching)\n\n\n## **Abstract**\nSince the previous 2M EVMOS Liquidity Incentive was first launched on Diffusion, Evmos native liquidity and ecosystem has shown encouraging growth. At the same time, we are also experiencing some difficulties. The TVL on Diffusion has grown to a height of $7.4M and since Evmos price fell, the TVL has gone down to $2.5M (2023.01.18). During the process, we found 3 issues: first, multiple bridges and liquidity fragmentation; second, mercenary liquidity and reward dumping; and third, the lack of the ecosystem building and Evmos use cases, damaging Evmos’ value. The EVMOS Incentive on Diffusion ended on 2023.01.19.\n\n\n## **Strategy**\n\nWe're trying some new measures to improve Evmos native liquidity and ecosystem.\n\n#### **1. Concentrated Liquidity**\nAlthough Evmos has $2.5M in native liquidity, it is mainly split into 13 trading pairs. We recommend temporarily focusing Evmos Incentive on a single bridge and major trading pairs (ATOM, USDC, wETH, etc.), in order to concentrate the limited liquidity.\nAccording to community's feedbacks, we plan to start from Axelar as the single bridge to concentrate liquidity first. More bridges and assets such as grav.USDT / ceUSDC / stEVMOS (stride) can be added after the effective growth of liquidity.\n\n#### **2. LP Bonding**\nTo incentivize long-term liquidity providers and to avoid the adverse effects of mercenary liquidity, SpaceFi Farm supports LP Bonding, including no bonding, 7 days unbonding and 14 days unbonding. The longer the LP is locked in the farm, the higher the APR will be.\n\n#### **3. Ecosystem Building**\nEvmos Liquidity Incentive is a short-term booster. And the thriving ecosystem projects are the long-term value. SpaceFi has been actively helping new projects get started in Evmos through Incubation and [Launchpad Program](https://twitter.com/spacefi_io/status/1584913982036803594). We've incubated [Soul Network](https://thesoul.network), a cross-chain DID network Cosmos \u0026 Ethereum, and also the First Place Winner in the Web3 track of Evmos Hackathon.\n\n\n## **Action Plan**\n\nAccording to the community's feedbacks, we plan to apply for 1M EVMOS as the liquidity incentive to start, in a program lasting 90 days, and expect to bring $4-$8M native liquidity with ARP 37% (no bonding) - 73% (14 days unbonding), similar to it on Osmosis. The above is based on Evmos price of $0.46 on 2023.01.18. If the liquidity grows well, we may apply to increase the incentive for the further growth.\n\n\n#### **1. Why Liquidity Incentive**\nEvmos native liquidity is still very small and further improvement of liquidity is a priority. In fact, 1M EVMOS is about 2 days' inflationary rewards of Evmos delegating. The value brought by the Liquidity Incentive will exceed the reward itself.\n\nThis proposal is not only about Liquidity Incentive, but also about an ecosystem project SpaceFi's whole launching. We hope to bring more use cases for Evmos and more confidence to the ecosystem and community through SpaceFi's performance.\n\n\n#### **2. Use xEVMOS as the reward, not EVMOS directly**\nThe [xEVMOS module](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8598-preproposal-new-evmos-liquidity-incentive-and-spacefi-whole-launching) is aimed to incentivize long-term holders and reduce reward dumping.\n\nWe‘ll launch a non-tradable reward token, xEVMOS, converted 1:1 from the EVMOS requested.\nxEVMOS earned from liquidity incentive can be converted back to EVMOS with a 30 days unbonding period. Users can also choose to unbond xEVMOS immediately, which will only convert back to 50% in EVMOS. The other 50% will be transferred back to the multisig address of requested EVMOS, which can make the incentive program last longer.\n\nWith xEVMOS, we can reduce reward spending and dumping while maintaining an attractive APR and incentivizing long-term holders. The liquidity incentive can last more than 90 days if some users choose to unbond xEVMOS immediately. We can also offer xEVMOS module as a public good for other incentive programs in Evmos ecosystem.\n\n\n#### **3. Multisig Group (3 of 5)**\n- 0xCtrlAltApe | Orbital Apes team\n- LPX | Evmos DAO Governance\n- luisqa | Zenith Station validator\n- devd331 | Evmos Community Mod, SpaceFi Captain\n- cryptoallen | SpaceFi team\n\nMultisig Address: [0x0bDA81150691522B2Ba0B4e936e498613F795c77](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0x0bDA81150691522B2Ba0B4e936e498613F795c77/home)\n(evmos1p0dgz9gxj9fzk2aqkn5ndeycvylhjhrhptq7tv)\n\n\n## **Fund Utilization Plan**\n\nWe divide the pairs into MAJOR, STABLE, and MINOR categories, borrowing from the incentive allocation in Kickstart DeFi on Evmos proposal by benny lava and other Evmos Governance members. The initial rewards are allocated as follows:\n\n\n#### **MAJOR: 50%, 5555 EVMOS / day + 29165 SPACE / day**\nEVMOS / ATOM - total 250k EVMOS + 1312380 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / ETH - total 175k EVMOS + 918720 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / BTC - total 125k EVMOS + 393750 SPACE\n\n\n\n#### **STABLE: 35%, 3888 EVMOS / day + 20414 SPACE / day**\nEVMOS / USDC - total 350k EVMOS + 1837260 SPACE\n\n\n\n#### **MINOR: 15%, 1666 EVMOS / day + 8754 SPACE / day**\nEVMOS / OSMO - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / JUNO - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE\n\nEVMOS / SPACE - total 50k EVMOS + 262620 SPACE\n\n\n\n\nThe reward weight for each pair can be adjusted each two weeks based on liquidity \u0026 volume data.\n\n\n\nTVL Milestone: 1M-2M, APR 146% (no bonding) - 293% (14 days unbonding)\n\nTVL Milestone: 2M-4M, APR 73% (no bonding) - 146% (14 days unbonding)\n\nTVL Milestone: 4M-8M, APR 37% (no bonding) - 73% (14 days unbonding)\n\nThe above TVL and APR is based on Evmos price of $0.46 on 2023.01.18.\n\n\n## **This is not just another proposal for Liquidity Incentive**\n\n[SpaceFi](https://spacefi.io/) is a community project with no VC funding, and has been building in the EVMOS ecosystem since February 2022 at our own expense. We want to make it an engine in the ecosystem with DEX+NFT+Spacebase+Launchpad, not just a DEX. At the same time as the EVMOS Liquidity Incentive begins, we will fully launch the SpaceFi product and SPACE token.\n\n\nThe initial emission of SPACE token will be about 125000 SPACE / day, 70% of which will be used for farming rewards, i.e. 87500 SPACE / day. We will allocate 2/3 of the SPACE farming reward to EVMOS Liquidity Incentive, i.e. 58350 SPACE / day. The remaining 1/3 will be allocated to SPACE \u0026 Planet NFT staking and other liquidity incentives.\n\n\nSpace Swap and Planet NFT are already live on Evmos mainnet.\n[Space Swap](https://swap-evmos.spacefi.io/#/swap) has been running on Evmos since May 2022 to date, with more than 2,000 early adopters providing liquidity on it. [Planet NFT](https://www.orbitmarket.io/collection/0x32c8e6e1ad9d356f1b010cca8de00c11510e8470) is the Pass of SpaceFi ecosystem, early minting has been finished on EVMOS mainnet and is currently the second largest market cap NFT in EVMOS ecosystem.\n\n[Learn more about SpaceFi Products](https://twitter.com/spacefi_io/status/1607655332456857601)\n\n\n## **What will happen next if this proposal is passed**\n\n- Space Farm, NFT Staking / Marketplace, Spacebase, Launchpad modules will be launched on EVMOS mainnet. (within 1 month)\n- SPACE Token launching and Evmos Liquidity Incentive begins. (the 1st week, trial run)\n- SPACE Token and EVMOS Liquidity Incentive fully runs. Genesis Spacebase event will be launched. (the 2nd week)\n- Spacebase farming reward PK competition. (the 3rd-5th week)\n- SpaceFi trading contest. (the 7th-9th week)\n- As liquidity grows, we will consider helping new projects to launch on Evmos through Launchpad, possibly Soul Network or others. (TBD)\n- Collaborate with other projects to enrich the use cases. More bridges and assets such as grav.USDT / ceUSDC / stEVMOS (stride) can be added after the effective growth of liquidity. (TBD)\n\n\n## **About SpaceFi**\n\n[spacefi.io](https://spacefi.io/) is a cross-chain web3 platform on Evmos and layer2 zkSync, with DEX+NFT+Launchpad+Spacebase as the initial product. The first to connect Cosmos and Layer2. It has been building in Evmos ecosystem since 2022.02. More than 40k users have tested SpaceFi products on Evmos and zkSync testnet.\n\n\nSpaceFi has previously conducted extensive testing and completed three contract audits. Here are the Audit Reports by [QuillAudits](https://twitter.com/QuillAudits) , a leading smart contract audit firm who has secured more than 700+ web3 projects with $15B+. A new audit report about xEVMOS module will also be released soon. We'll make the products well tested and audited before the whole launching.\n\n[Audit Report-3](https://github.com/Quillhash/QuillAudit_Reports/blob/master/SpaceFi%20Farm%20Smart%20Contract%20Final%20Audit%20Report%20-%20QuillAudits.pdf)  |  [Audit Report-2](https://github.com/Quillhash/QuillAudit_Reports/blob/master/SpaceFi%20Swap%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20Report%20-%20QuillAudits.pdf)  |  [Audit Report-1](https://github.com/Quillhash/QuillAudit_Reports/blob/master/SpaceFi%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20Report%20-%20QuillAudits.pdf)",

        "title": "Encode Club's Evmos Grant Proposal",
        "description": "# Encode Club's Evmos Grant Proposal\n\n## Summary\n\n• Encode Club is requesting approximately $2.5MM (5,200,000 EVMOS tokens @ $.48) to award to the best builders and projects for the duration of the grants program. Allocated funds are to be kept in the Multisig controlled by the Evmos community and distributed only when needed by Encode via multisig composed of trusted community advisory members. Encode's monthly expenses for running the program will be $50k, which can be considered as part of the total requested grants amount as per the community's preference.\n\n• Encode Club is a web3 education community. We help people learn, build and launch their web3 careers. We do this through high quality events such as educate series, hackathons, accelerators and bootcamps.\n\n•Encode Club will organize a pilot grants program for the Evmos community for H1 2023 (Jan to July). Their team will be entrusted with their promotion and furthermore tasked with evaluation of the best projects submissions, making sure that each is up to the standards set by the community.\n\n•Regular community calls shall be established and kept open to both the community and the DAO, which are to be used for questions, feedback and general updates about the program's progress. Additionally, 3 special check-in calls will be scheduled and executed throughout the program - one following the successful setup of the grants program, one midway through and one at the very end, the purpose of which is for Encode to provide further insight regarding grant applications and subsequently grantees.\n\n**Multisig Address**: 0x525C1cd42CBca9878bb3bF96DB269EDfc2F10db5\n\n**Multisig Committee (4/7)**:\n\n•   Lit | Notional Lab\n\n•   GV | Swiss Staking\n\n•   Luisqa | Zenith Station\n\n•   Outcast | Legion Nodes\n\n•   Sigmund | Quelabs\n\n•   Bosco | Silknodes\n\n•   Ömer | Alkadeta\n\n ## Abstract\n\n Establishing an effective grants program is important to champion the growth and development of the Evmos ecosystem because it provides support for projects and initiatives that align with the ecosystem's goals and objectives. This funding can be used to help new protocols launch, research and development, infrastructure, community building, public goods, and other activities that contribute to the growth and success of the ecosystem. Additionally, a grants program can attract and retain talented individuals and organizations to Evmos, as well as increase collaboration and partnerships within the community. Overall, an effective grants program can play a key role in driving innovation, fostering collaboration, and promoting the long-term sustainability of the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nEncode is one of the most trusted and well known companies within the web3 space, known for delivery of top tier program in partnership with the biggest names in the industry. Over the past two years their team has managed to successfully execute more than 90 events (both online and in-person).\n\n## Motivation\n\nEncode Club’s core goal has always been to deliver top tier programs that aid enthusiasts, developers and projects alike in growing, achieving their goals and pushing the web3 space forward. Evmos is a young and blooming ecosystem, and similar to others at this stage of their growth - it is in need of builders that would keep pushing it further and raise the bar higher.\n\nBy leveraging the curiosity, knowledge and dedication of their 50,000+ strong developer community, Encode Club can foster high levels of engagement and building for the Evmos ecosystem. Coupled with their past experience of running Saddle’s successful grants program and already having led an Evmos Hackathon through Covelant, their track record proves they are more than capable of successfully executing a program of this magnitude.\n\nFlawless execution of great events is often considered the end result of Encode Club’s efforts. In reality, however, these events are the means by which the true output and contribution to the web3 space is being achieved - identifying talent.\n\nEncode Club is a talent powerhouse.Their community consists of some of the brightest minds of tomorrow - actively participating in a wide variety of events, engaging with different technologies and most importantly - building.\n\n## Proposal\n\nEncode Club will dedicate 8-10 people from their team to deliver an exclusive pilot grants program that will run for the duration of the first half of 2023 with the option of extending it until the end of the year. Their team will be responsible for handling each and every phase of the project including, but not limited to planning, promoting, sourcing, executing and judging.\n\nThe Evmos community and team are to be an integral part, functioning as a guiding power and influencing the general direction of the program that the Encode team shall pursue in order to accomplish the objectives outlined by the community and Evmos Core Team.\n\nEncode is to be allocated $2.5MM for the duration of the grants program. The amount will be kept within a multisig, with distributions approved and executed by the Evmos committee multisig in the form of rewards.Their recipients are to be the best developers and projects picked by Encode for fulfilling the prerequisites and goals outlined by the program.\n\nEncode Club will crowdsource ideas for bounties from the community and will decide what bounty size to allocate for each. Each of the bounties should consist of:\n\n•   Brief summary and explanation\n\n•   Clearly outlined deliverables\n\n•   Execution and delivery within the timeline of the program\n\n•   Amount of funding attached\n\nThere will be two types of bounties:\n\n•   Competitions – several projects compete and the best gets the bounty award at the end of the program.\n\n•   Award – a single team is selected to answer the bounty, and receives the award upon completion by the end of the program.\n\nBounties will be listed on the Encode website and public calls for participants will be made. Encode Club will take care of promoting and marketing the initiative as well as organize several education events with community members and investors from the Evmos community throughout the bounty period.\n\nTeams then engage in working, building and polishing their projects by the deadline outlined in the program. The best are to be invited, judged and rewarded in proportion to their efforts and magnitude of impact for the Evmos ecosystem in a show and tell finale events organized by Encode.\n\nIn order to ensure transparency and accountability on Encode Club’s side an Evmos Multisig Committee with representatives from both the community will be in direct communication with Encode and will have power to challenge their decisions along the way. The multisig will be overseeing the funds allocation and provide an additional layer of security for Evmos community. Any remaining funds at the end of the initial grants program period will be rolled into future funding upon approval, or returned to the community pool if the community decides not to renew the program.\n\n**Cost Breakdown**:\n\nEncode is a 25 person team and will be putting significant effort across multiple departments and individuals. The following is a rough outline of the costs associated with the proper execution of the grants pilot program:\n\n•   Marketing and Sourcing: $10k per month (on average 2 people)\n\n•   Program Management: $15k per month (on average 2 people)\n\n•   Grant Team Management: $15k per month (on average 2 people)\n\n•   Book-keeping, Finances + Admin: $2.5k per month (on average 1 person)\n\n•   Hiring support for any grantees: $5k per month (on average 1 person)\n\n•   Tech and Infrastructure: $2.5k per month\n\nThis brings the total monthly cost of running the program to $50k. The amount is to be invoiced in advance prior every month and deducted from the total grant size allocated for the program execution.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf successful, Encode will be able to start executing as early as mid/late February. Gathering bounty proposals from both the community and the Evmos team will begin immediately after approval.The marketing team will switch focus on promoting the grant program, while also turning the attention of Encode’s existing Cosmos and Evmos hackers within the community to the upcoming events.\n\nGrant applicants will work closely with Encode Club’s program managers throughout the duration of the program in order to ensure that their work follows the guidelines and meets the requirements outlined by the bounties in order to qualify for a grant. Encode will impose deadlines for project submissions, after which the best builders will be invited to present their work live and compete for a prize from the grants pool.\n\nFor more supporting details and dicussion, please reference the [Commonwealth Post](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/8549-encode-clubs-evmos-grants-proposal).\n\n**Voting**\n\n•   By voting **YES**, indicates approval of the proposal in its current form.\n\n•   By voting **NO**, indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form.\n\n•   By voting **ABSTAIN**, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\n•   By voting **NOWITHVETO**, indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.",

        "description": "## Author(s)\n- LPX, Evmos DAO \n- Leibing, Covalent\n\n## Summary\n\nDue to the decrease in the price of EVMOS, there is a deficit in the amount of tokens that were originally asked from the pool from [Proposal 54](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/54) and the amount that is needed to pay out all the rewards from the hackathon. It is our belief that it is paramount for the hackathon winners to be rewarded for contributions and efforts in a timely manner to encourage the continued interest and growth of the developer community in the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n- [Commonwealth Discussion](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/9429-time-sensitive-evmos-x-covalent-hackathon-payouts-readjustment)\n- [Hackathon Page and Winners](https://www.encode.club/evmoscovalent-hack)\n\n## Abstract\n\n- The Covalent x Encode x Evmos Community hackathon concluded last month with participants joining from around the world.\n- At the time of the passing of Proposal 54, EVMOS was around $2.50. Currently, the price of EVMOS is ~$0.475.\n- This proposal is requesting funds from the Community Pool to balance the rewards payable to current market price as promised in Proposal 54. The total amount requested can be found in the Amount Requested section below.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe #OneMillionWallets hackathon was a successful event that brought together members of the Ethereum as well as Evmos Community to work on exciting projects. However, the price of the EVMOS token has dropped significantly since the hackathon was funded by Proposal #54, resulting in a deficit that needs to be filled in order to pay out the participants.\n\nThis proposal aims to ensure that the hard work and effort put in by the participants is rewarded, and that the Evmos Community continues to be a supportive and collaborative space for innovation. Additionally, this proposal will demonstrate Evmos commitment to its Community and show that it keeps its promises.\n\nThe original proposal clearly stated the following: 'The amount of tokens for the hackathon prizes of $100k will be determined at time of dispersement. In the case of extreme price volatility, the Governance workstream will assist in readjusting the community pool funding request.'\n\n## Message from Covalent\n\nThank you for your patience in staying with us and navigating this situation together. The Evmos-Covalent #OneMillionWallets hackathon concluded in December 2022 to great success, where we saw more than 500+ teams registering, more than 60+ projects built, and more than 100 daily quiz participants. It was our biggest and most successful #OMW hackathon to date.\n\nDue to the depreciation of the prize pool, however, we cannot give the winners what we feel they truly deserve. We know how important runway is for teams building in an ecosystem; such runway can only be achieved when the teams are rewarded at the amount after the price movements have been adjusted. We deeply appreciate the EvmosDAO Governance workstream's efforts in readjusting the community pool fund to ensure that projects get the deserved level of funding.\n\n- Leibing, DevRel, Covalent\n\n## Amount Requested\n\nThe amount requested pegs the EVMOS price to $0.40 due to market uncertainty. All leftover EVMOS will be returned to the community pool.\n\nThe total amount of rewards payable came out to be $60,950 instead of the planned $100K. 50% of the funds in the original multisig that were originally allocated for the hackathon rewards, or 50,200 EVMOS (~$20,080) will be used to help fill this deficit.\n\n- $40,870 ($60,950 - $20,080) for the deficit in the amount of the hackathon winners' rewards (~102,175 EVMOS tokens @ 0.40). [Detailed sheet.](https://evmos.community/covalent-hackathon)\n- $17,799 for the organizers of the hackathon (~44,497.5 EVMOS tokens @ 0.40)\n- 20,000 EVMOS tokens for a donor that tried to assist in filling the deficit ([TX](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/txs/001094A2EECF02AD8739030656BCECE936F8BECABCD4A6B6FD0FF2166ECF8096))\n- **Grand Total: $58,669 + 20,000 EVMOS (roughly 166.6K EVMOS)**\n\nNote: This funding request is specifically for the outstanding amount required to pay out the participants and organizers of the hackathon. The 50% that was initially allocated to Covalent for their services will be released to Covalent - there are no plans to re-adjust the indexing and API integration fees at the moment. The decision to delay the staking of the other 50% by Covalent was not the responsibility of the Evmos Community.\n\nRemaining tokens, assuming that the Evmos token price holds above $0.40 will be sent back to the Community Pool.\n",

This proposal has a voting time of 5 days.\\n\\n## Motivation\\n\\nBy proposing a scheduled upgrade, we want to implement a smooth and transparent upgrade process. Software upgrades generally aim to improve current performance and add new features to the Evmos chain. For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validators/upgrades/overview.html).\\n\\n## Impact\\n\\nEvmos v11.0.0 contains the following changes and enhcements:\\n\\n- Add ICA host functionality to enable liquid staking support via Liquid Staking Zones (e.g Stride and Quicksilver)\\n- Add distribution logic for incentivized testnet rewards\\n- Implement daily instead of annual recalculation of minted coins during inflation\\n- Update implementation of module parameters after [deprecation of x/params module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/modules/params/)\\n- Migration of IBC transfer escrow accounts to the 'ModuleAccount' type\\n- Update IBC-Go to v6.1.0 and Ethermint to v0.21.0\\n- Add missing store keys in the inflation module\\n- Store evm params under a single key for performance optimization\\n\\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/tag/v11.0.0).\\n\\nNOTE: Starting with Cosmos SDK v0.46 it is not possible to include links to Windows binaries in software upgrade proposals anymore.\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/main/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade has been manually performed on a local node.\\nOn top of the upgrade tests, the Evmos team runs performance tests to monitor the impact of new versions.",

        "description": "# ECP-2A: Formalizing and Funding the Governance Workstream (Rev. 2)\n\n## Authors \n- LPX | Evmos DAO\n- GV | Evmos DAO \n- Benny Lava | Evmos DAO\n\nOperating under the community-ratified Interim Constituion of Evmos DAO ([Proposal #51](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/51)), the Governance Workstream has been serving the Evmos DAO and Community without funding for the past eight months. We are officially requesting formalization by funding.\n\nThis proposal applies all rules defined and approved by the community in ECP-1 ([Proposal #83](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/83)). An [FAQ page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/faq.md) has been created and will kept up to date with important questions asked by the Community.\n\n## Preface \n\nFollowing the rejection of Proposal 86, we have conducted a thorough review of the initial proposal and the valuable feedback provided by the Evmos community and validators. This revised proposal was created with objectives to address issues and concerns raised by the community while remaining aligned with the Governance Workstream's Mission, Vision, and Values. We are confident that this revised proposal achieves this goal.\n\nAddressed issues from Proposal 86:\n\n- The total token request has been significantly [reduced by 80% in this proposal](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/revision.md).\n- R\u0026D, Ecosystem Bootstrap, and Treasury Diversification funds have been excluded in order to facilitate a more targeted dialogue with the community regarding these initiatives and potential funding.\n- The retroactive payment request has been decreased by 64% ($750/mo per contributor).\n- Additional cost-saving measures include the elimination of 2 future workstream contributors and the request for only the first year of vesting emissions for existing members.\n\n## Abstract\n\n### The Governance Workstream's Mandate\n\nThe Governance Council exists and operates as a neutral party with allegiances only to the Evmos network and the guiding values of the Evmos Constitution. While the workstream is tasked with various duties, our mandate is simple: to facilitate and protect the integrity of Evmos' governance processes and, to the best of our ability, create a fair and transparent environment in which the network and the community can prosper and thrive.\n\n- Duties, Responsibilities, Deliverables of the Governance Workstream: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/duties.md)\n\n### Contributions to Evmos\n\nThe Governance Workstream's wide array of contributions and community service for the past half-year range from simple proposal guidance for projects to both native and external liquidity programs responsible for the movement of tens of millions of dollars. \n\n- List of Achievements and Progress Report: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/report.md)\n\n### Progressive Decentralization \n\nWe also want to emphasize that we are not trying to hold on to power or exert control over the ecosystem. We expect to be scrutinized every funding cycle, and replaced if needed. Our goal is to accelerate the development of the decentralized ecosystem, and to create a future in which power is distributed back to the Evmos Community.\n\nWhile we have ambitious plans to create an ecosystem of community owned liquidity and a democratized spending of liquid funds, we have removed all funding requests related to these initiatives for various reasons - separate proposals will be made for these initiatives when we are better prepared to present them.\n\n## Funding Request\n\nThis 6-month funding proposal has been pegged to the price of $0.40 / EVMOS. The total funding amount was reduced by ~80% to the previous proposal and represents now 0.81% of the community pool. The dollar amount requested at current price was also reduced from $2.37mil to $380K. For a breakdown of the ask reduction, please [refer to this page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/revision.md).\n\n**Contributor Compensations**\n\nThe funding ask includes the base, retro, and vesting pay for 3 existing Governance workstream members as well as the onboarding of three more members, for a total of 6 Governance workstream members.\n- A detailed outline of contributor compensation: [Detailed Page](https://github.com/EvmosGov/proposals/blob/main/ECP/2A/contributors.md)\n\n**Total:** 950,000 EVMOS\n\n### Fund Disbursements\n\nThis funding proposal will kick off the \"DAO Treasury\" which is managed by 3 Governance members and 5 Validators in a `5-8` Gnosis Safe configuration. All treasury spending will be publicly viewable with full transparency. Spending, compensations, swaps, and all expense reports will be rigorously kept up to date. \n\n**Treasury Signatories**:\n\n- Tam | TC Network\n- CO | Orbital Apes\n- Long | Notional\n- OutCast | Legion Nodes\n- Yubin Park | a41\n- Benny | Governance\n- LPX | Governance\n- GV | Governance\n\n**Safe Deployment Address**: [0xC3C5156911bf53f12913b68E0532096536B30600](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0xC3C5156911bf53f12913b68E0532096536B30600) (evmos1c0z326g3haflz2gnk68q2vsfv5mtxpsqgqgd0v)\n\n## Forum\nFull discussion can be found on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/9421-ecp2a-formalizing-and-funding-the-governance-workstream-rev-2).\n",

        "description": "## DoraHacks Hackathon Proposal with Evmos\n\n### Summary\n\nThe [DoraHacks](dorahacks.io) Team, one of world's most active multi-chain Web3 developer incentive platform, proposes a hackathon partnership with the Evmos community to help attract developers and promote growth within the Evmos ecosystem.\n\nThe Hackathon prize pool will be approximately $125k (281,000 EVMOS @ $.44) of non-dilutive funding through a community controlled multisig to be given out as EVMOS tokens to Hackathon winners that show the most promise and meet the needs of the team.\n\n### Abstract\n\nDoraHacks is a global hacker movement and the world's most active multi-chain Web3 developer incentive platform. More than 3,000 projects from the DoraHacks community have received over $30 million in grants and hackathon prizes. DoraHacks.io has around 250,000 active users worldwide. The platform offers hackathons, bounties, quadratic funding, privacy voting, and other community governance/funding toolkits. In addition, over 80 major Web3 ecosystems are currently using Dora infrastructures to fund their open-source communities\n\nThe Evmos Hackathon Partnership aims to align all stakeholders by incentivizing individuals and organizations to explore and develop their ideas on Evmos by offering individuals and organizations non-dilutive funding to develop and further the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n### Proposal\n\n **Goal:**\n\n**1. Branding**\n\n• To leverage DoraHacks’ developer community and DoraHacks.io platform’s traffic to promote Evmos’ dev toolkits and APIs, and onboard more developers to adopt Evmos’s tech stacks and build on Evmos\n\n• To leverage DoraHacks’ expertise in organizing hackathons, virtual or in-person hackathons, workshops, and project demo sessions to help the Evmos team operate developer events globally.\n\n• To involve Evmos in the hackathons, quadratic funding community grants and other events DoraHacks co-host with different open Web3 ecosystems, for instance, BNB Chain, Solana, Filecoin, Avalanche, Moonriver, Polygon, Harmony and more.\n\n**2. Education**\n\n• To host workshops for developers to help them better understand how to build in the Evmos Ecosystem.\n\n**3. Innovation**\n\n•To incentivize global developers to build on Evmos by providing prizes, grants, and investments to the teams emerging from the events DoraHacks and Evmos organize together.\n\n**Scope of Partnership:**\n\n**Hackathons**\n\n**DoraHacks will host virtual and in-person hackathons globally each year. DoraHacks can help the Evmos Foundation with the following**\n\n• Facilitate Evmos global and regional hackathons, dedicated fully to the ecosystem growth of Evmos\n\n• Participate in DoraHacks hackathons, co-hosted with other leading blockchain companies and open ecosystems, as a co-host/sponsor/partner, depending on the exclusivity and scope of the hackathons.\n\n**In the hackathons, DoraHacks will be covering the main operational efforts, including:**\n\n• Basic Logistics of the hackathons - agenda, workshops, judge invitations, promotion material design, etc.\n\n• Hacker and team recruitment: DoraHacks will work with global partners to recruit participants for the hackathon.\n\n**Evmos will be expected to provide the following resources:**\n\n• Prize Pool - the incentive for global devs to participate. From our experience, $125K worth of prize pool can incentivize 50-100 teams to join and build in the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n• Idealists and tracks - Which sectors do you want participating developers and teams to be the focus of the hackathon?\n\n• Invitation of Mentors and part of the Judging panel - core team members are expected to participate in the hackathons to support participating teams and devs.\n\n• Workshops - to better guide devs and projects on project development.\n\n• Workshops can be divided into two categories: technical workshops and business workshops. Speakers can give presentations depending on their expertise. Mentors are also expected to deliver workshops to hackathon participants.\n\n• Marketing Resources - the foundation’s official resources are crucial in the success of the promotion of the Hackathon.Press releases in leading media channels, Twitter promotion and interaction, important promotion efforts like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko banners, etc.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n**Q1/2 2023 - TBC**\n\n**Kick-off Preparation**\n\nEvmos team to confirm the details of the hackathon (Kick-off/closing dates, prizes, tracks, idea lists, partners, goals, scale, budget)\n\n• Set up meetings with DoraHacks to confirm the details\n\n**Q1 2023**\n\n• Evmos and DoraHacks team finalize on tracks and idea lists\n• Evmos and DoraHacks team reach out to partners and judges\n• Evmos and DoraHacks teamwork on the landing page and promotion materials.\n• DoraHacks deploys the Evmos Hackathon page.\n• All tracks/idealists confirmed\n• All mentors/judges confirmed\n•All workshop confirmed\n• Landing page done\n• DoraHacks \u0026 Evmos jointly promote on all channels to recruit global developers to apply for the hackathon.\n• All media partners confirmed\n\n**Official Hackathon promotion + developer community promotion + project submission**\n\n**Late Q1/Q2 2023 (TBC)**\n\n• Evmos Hackathon Opening Ceremony(Virtual, hosted by DoraHacks)\n• Evmos Hackathon workshops from core team and partners (Virtual)\n• Campaign on all social media platforms and media\n**Submissions**\n• Project Submission\n•Project demo session of selected excellent projects\n**Judging**\n• Judges decide on the winners of the hackathon\n• Evmos Global Hackathon Closing ceremony(Hosted by DoraHacks)\n\n**Post Hackathon**\n• Promotion and incubation of star projects coming out from the hackathon.\n• Preparation for Evmos Hackathon 2.\n\n### Amount Requested\n\nThe prize pool will be approximately $125k (281,000 EVMOS @ $.44) of non-dilutive funding to be given out as EVMOS tokens directly to Hackathon winners.

Once converted they can be used within the broader IBC ecosystem. This will allow users to bridge out/into Ethereum (and other EVM chains) through the Celer Bridge on Evmos. \\n## What is Celer\\nCeler cBridge is a decentralized and non-custodial asset bridge that supports 110+ tokens across 30+ blockchains and layer-2 rollups. Built on top of the Celer Inter-chain Message Framework, cBridge has processed ~B cross-chain asset transfer volume on 30+ blockchains for more than 160K unique users, and is quickly growing and expanding into more blockchains and layer-2s.\\n\\n## Contracts to Register\\nPlease verify each contract address on escan.live before casting your vote.

        "description": "# Build A Community Owned DEX (UniV3)\n## Authors\n-  [Orbital Apes](https://twitter.com/OrbitalApes)\n-  [Evmos DAO](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO)\n\n## Summary\nThe Evmos DAO and Orbital Apes team aim to deliver a fully community owned DEX within two months. We believe that Evmos can become market competitive in terms of liquidity and user experience. \n\n- No investment token \n- No initial swap fees \n- Not profit oriented\n- UniV3 functionalities (concentrated liquidity)\n- Integrated IBC asset and continous development guaranteed\n\nIf this proposal passes, we will ship a V3 DEX deployment in the shortest amount of time. The OA team will handle the engineering side, while the responsibilities of socials management, proposals for incentives and incentives management would be handled by the EvmosDAO.\n\nThe requested funds is for the Orbital Apes team only since the Evmos DAO is already fully funded. Funding is requested as this DEX will be built as public good for Evmos and will not have any funding coming from token sales or protocol fees.\n\n*Notes: This can be seen as an alternative to the ICHI proposal. We believe that we can ship a more feature rich DEX at **much lower costs**. To our knowledge, UniV3 is not adding new chains any time soon due to legal reasons.*\n\n\n## Goal\nCreate a capital efficient AMM to grow native liquidity on Evmos. This will be achieved with the help of EvmosDAO by creating cross-chain proposals for co-incentives (Evmos and Partnering chain) to LP providers and cross-chain token swaps to create protocol-owned liquidity managed by EvmosDAO.\n\n## Deployment Path of UniV3 Fork\n\n- Engineer custom V3 DEX frontend with IBC\u003c\u003eERC20 conversion\n- Fork UniV3 and deploy modified contracts (no protocol fees, no investement token) in April\n- Bridge integration  \n- Keplr integration (third party dependency)\n\n### Benefits  \n**1 - Liquidity**\nThe Evmos DAO team will be making proposals on other IBC chains to incentivize this DEX along with supplemented Evmos incentives.Protocol owned liquidty would work along side this as well. This will allow Evmos to build more native liquidity and force wider users to IBC tokens into Evmos. After this more DeFi protocols can be built once on chain liquidity is established.\n\n**2 - Time to market**\nWe are market ready within two months. Targetting testnet before April and mainnet once the UniV3 license expires. \n*Side note: The whole cosmos ecosystem is moving towards LSD's. V3 positions are much more tuned for these pools then traditional Dex's. V3 is may more profitable for LP's and provides a much stronger peg between something like stAtom/Atom. If we wait 5 months instead of 2 months we could potentially lose a large chunk of this liquidity to other protocols.*\n\n**3 - Keplr integration**\nIn the near future Keplr is going to have full EVM compatibiltiy. The users will be able to interact with Keplr and Metamask on the DEX.\n\n- [ERC20 Support](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet/pull/531)\n- [Tx Signing Support](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet/pull/483)\n- Contracts signing: Once contracts signing is integrated by Keplr the OA will merge it into the DEX.\n\n**4 - IBC conversion page**\nSimilar to https://app.evmos.org/assets, this will provide a user friendly interface and reduce complexity of onboarding cosmos based users. A bridge section will be added to deposit/withdraw from multiple EVM chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and many more through Satellite (Axelar). \n\n**5 - No Protocol Fees** \nTraditional decentralized exchanges charge a fee on every swap that flows directly to the protocol or token holders. Initially this will be set to zero, any changes of the fee structure must be approved by the Evmos governance in form of a text proposal. LP fees will still be charged and distributed on swaps to LP providers.\n\n**6 - No Investment Token**\nThe community owned DEX will not have a corresponding governance token. As a community owned project built by OA/EvmosDAO future major developments will be funded through seperate funding requests or grants programs/boutnies. Incentives for liquidity will come in the form of Evmos incentives proposals and Cross-Chain incentives proposals.\n\n\n**7 - Future Development: All the upcoming Evmos/Cross-Chain innovation**\n- New innovation like ICA and ICQ will be actively explored and integrated the best possible way to stay competitive. Such integration would require a seperate funding request.\n- Explore and integrate cross-chain bridge swaps through services such as LiFi.\n\n\n## Milestones\n\n- Deploy the AMM V3 (Contracts/Frontend/Backend) to the Evmos Testnet | Funds realesed: 40% two weeks after testnet \n- Deploy the AMM V3 (Contracts/Frontend/Backend) to the Evmos Mainnet | Funds realesed: 40% two weeks after mainnet \n- IBC conversion page integration | Funds realesed: 10% after functional integration \n- Keplr integration | Funds realesed: 10% after functional integration \n\n\n## Funding Amount\nThis funding proposal will kick off the development for V3. The requested amount of 200,000 Evmos goes fully to the OA team since the Evmos DAO is already funded by the Evmos community.\n\nSignatories (3/4 Threshold):\n- GV | DAO \n- CtrlAltApe | OA\n- Luisqa | Zenith Station\n- Silk Nodes \n\nSafe Deployment Address: [0x7B4Ca78E62e06De7A921DF03A319ff09A09A84D0](https://safe.evmos.org/evmos:0x7B4Ca78E62e06De7A921DF03A319ff09A09A84D0/home?showCreationModal=true)\n\n**Risk / Risk Mitigation**\nRisk: The OA team fails to deliver an AMM for the community.\nMitigation: Funds are held in a multisig and are paid out on completion of milestones.\n",

        "description": "# Summary\nAs part of the Cosmos ZERO initiative with Regen Network, we would like to discuss bringing Evmos’s carbon emission to net zero (EvmosZERO) by employing community funds to offset Evmos's protocol validator set for the year 2022. This will be one of the first steps to kickstart ReFi on Evmos! \n\n# Author\nNemus | Stakecito\n Ghazni | Stakecito\n Twitter: [@stakecito](https://twitter.com/stakecito)) \n\n# Abstract\n\nDear Evmosians, we propose to fund 79,750 $EVMOS (= USD $23,925 at $0.3 per $EVMOS) from the Evmos community pool to purchase and retire 7,975 Nature Carbon Ton (USD $3 a credit) on Regen marketplace at [app.regen.network](https://app.regen.network/), to make the Evmos protocol carbon neutral for the year of 2022.\n\n## Regen Network Development PBC commits to hold and stake the 79,750 $EVMOS for 12 months, beginning as soon as the Evmos tokens are sent from the multi-sig address. Any unspent $EVMOS will be returned to the Evmos community pool.\n\nThis is an improved proposal version with a significantly reduced ask amount since we excluded CFCs (City Forest Credits) and added a 12-month Evmos price protection (courtesy of Regen Network Development PBC) after taking a lot of community feedback into account. You can find the link to the Commonwealth discussion [here](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/10149-prevote-kick-off-refi-on-evmos-offset-evmoss-carbon-emission-for-2022).\n\n## Multisig committee:\n\n-Nemus | Stakecito (0x4F2f657E265d8aA9Ea75dB7d7137594C42ce69Dc)\n\n-LPX | Evmos DAO Governance (0x02b8f20a5663c0679045ed9e6715b36c85b30f4b)\n\n-Dan | Qwoyn Validator (0x4d696630877a0584e30866d1444859fb8d9E5956)\n\n-Pete | Regenerator (0x0e722c4220bDaB54D15869f427969e9b7ecec5ca)\n\n-SR | Kalia Network (0xa955B26102F89CaBaf8E0366478E948516F11039)\n\n## Multisig contract (3/5) / recipient address: 0x2DE486f4CBC362A4BbD25968F88547f076B2C212 \n\n# EvmosZERO - kicking off ReFi on Evmos!\n\nWhy is offsetting Evmos’s carbon emission important for Evmos? Why is ReFi on Evmos a huge opportunity going forward?\n\nWell, carbon credits are financial assets that are rapidly becoming tokenized onto blockchains. Demand for carbon credits is expected to become a $500 billion + industry by 2030, and is already a 6 billion annual industry. The race is on!\n\nSome of the major Ethereum (VM) compatible blockchains, such as Polygon, offset their carbon emission by retiring $400,000 in carbon credits (104,794 tonnes) on KlimaDAO, a Polygon based ReFi market. The decision came after [Polygon’s $20 Million pledge](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-is-going-carbon-negative-in-2022-with-a-20-million-pledge) to become carbon negative in 2022.\n\nCelo, another EVM chain, went a step further and is not only [carbon negative from the get-go](https://blog.celo.org/a-carbon-negative-blockchain-its-here-and-it-s-celo-60228de36490), but it is increasingly becoming the EVM-hub for ReFi by actively investing in projects and collaborating with existing players such as Toucan Protocol on Polygon and Regen Network on Cosmos.\n\nAs a first step to kickstart ReFi on Evmos, we are inviting the Evmos protocol to become a part of the Cosmos ZERO initiative and to offset its carbon emission on the Regen Network for 2022. Evmos has its roots in Cosmos (Cosmos Hub prop 44) and this would demonstrate to all stakeholders in the space that strong alliances within the Cosmos ecosystem are possible.\n\nCosmos ZERO, a partnership of Regen Network and the Interchain Foundation, is an initiative for Cosmos protocols and validators to achieve net-zero carbon emissions for their network validator node infrastructure and operations.\n\n## [Cosmos ZERO Program](https://regennetwork.notion.site/Cosmos-ZERO-Achieve-Protocol-Validator-Net-Zero-Carbon-Emissions-ddd441e3ff3d4dbda83265433843ec10) \n## What are some of the potential synergies between Evmos \u0026 Regen that could be addressed in future proposals? \n- Add $EVMOS to the allowed currency list for Regen Network\n- Bring NCTs and CFCs as ERC-20 to Evmos\n- Launch $EVMOS/$NCT \u0026 $REGEN/$NCT pools on Evmos dexes\n- Help the Evmos validator set to improve the climate impact of their node infrastructure and thereby reduce the carbon footprint\n\nRegen is providing knowledge and resources to enable ReFi on Evmos. Regen also helped Evmos to push ReFi projects such as Gitcoin, supporting this on the Gitcoin end for many years. Offsetting on Regen is just a first step in this mutual partnership. \n\n## Voting \n- Voting YES indicates approval of the proposal in its current form.\n- Voting NO indicates disapproval of the proposal in its current form.\n- Voting ABSTAIN indicates you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n- Voting NOWITHVETO indicates stronger opposition to the proposal than simply voting No. If the number of NoWithVeto votes exceeds a third of the total votes excluding Abstain votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.",

        "description": "## Author\n\n- Evmos DAO [Telegram](t.me/evmosdao), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO)\n- Forge [Telegram](t.me/forgedex), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forgedex)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to provide liquidity of the Evmos treasury to the stEVMOS/EVMOS pair. We request 2M Evmos, with 1M Evmos allocated for liquid staking. All funds will be added to the Forge stEVMOS/EVMOS liquidity pool (~600k USD). It will be actively managed by the DAO, OA + two trusted and active community members. \n\n## Abstract\n\nThis initiative is designed to enhance the growth and long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. \n\nIt involves requesting 2M Evmos from the Evmos treasury and staking 1M Evmos in the liquid staking module of Stride. The DAO will then allocate 1M stEVMOS and 1M EVMOS to the Forge liquidity pool. This will improve the liquid staked token liquidity of Evmos in the market, and the allocation will be monitored and adjusted based on market conditions and community input.\n\nRewards Distribution and DAO Sustainability is another key initiative. The rewards generated from liquid staking and the Forge liquidity pool (LP fees) will be directed to the multisig wallet. A portion of the rewards will be used to cover the operational costs of the DEX to ensure long-term sustainability and growth. This includes development, maintenance, moderation, promotion, marketing, legal and compliance duties. As of today we have monthly costs of roughly ~1k USD (graph service, quote api). The remaining rewards will be allocated for Forge bounties. Bounties are a common way for decentralized exchanges to incentivize developers and security researchers to contribute to the platform. Here are some potential bounties: \n\n- Feature bounties: A feature bounty program incentivizes developers to contribute new features or improvements to the platform's codebase.\n- Education bounties: An education bounty program incentivizes users to create educational content about the platform, such as blog posts, videos, or tutorials.\n- Bug bounties: A bug bounty program rewards security researchers for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities or bugs in the platform's codebase.\n\nWe value transparency and accountability in all aspects of our operations, including our bounty programs. As part of our commitment to transparency, we will provide quarterly reports detailing the bounties we have offered and the costs associated with Forge.\n\nTo ensure the security and integrity of staked funds and community assets, Univ3 liquidity pools will be utilized, which have a proven track record of security and reliability on Ethereum. Acknowledging the potential risks associated with the liquid staking provider Stride, which has undergone multiple audits and implemented IBC limits to minimize vulnerabilities. As a comparison, the ATOM accelerator program also liquid staked around 60k ATOM (~600k USD) by using Stride. **Additionally, Stride has partnered with Forge and committed to incentivize pools on Forge with their own governance tokens.** \n\nBy implementing this proposal, the Evmos community can expect improved utility and value from the treasury funds, increased market liquidity, and a more sustainable DAO and Forge DEX model. A LSD pool by the treasury, along with the security measures in place, will contribute to the overall growth and success of the Evmos ecosystem. \n\n## Stride\n\nThe Stride DAO will be providing incentives as soon as technically possible. If the community provides treasury liquidity of stEVMOS/EVMOS it allows stride to incentivize different pools (like stEVMOS/USDC) instead which brings more external TVL into the Evmos ecosystem.\n\n## Timeframe\n\nAfter careful consideration and discussion, the general agreement is to pool these funds into a liquidity pool for a period of 6 months. A follow up proposal will be made to renew after the specified period. If the renewal is rejected, the 2M Evmos will be returned. The requested funds only provision liquidity to Forge. \n\nSide note: If a vault provider that is trusted deploys on Evmos, it could be worth considering entrusting the management of the LP position to the vault.\n\n## About Forge\n\nThe Evmos DAO and OA teamed up and delivered a fully UniV3 compatible DEX on Evmos. Forge is fully community owned and funded. \n\nWhat we offer is: \n\n- No investment token\n- No initial protocol fees\n- Not profit oriented\n- UniV3 functionalities (concentrated liquidity)\n- Integrated IBC asset (coming soon)\n- One click liquid staking button (coming soon)\n\n[See full proposal here](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/proposals/113)\n\n## Multisig 4/6\n\nThe position must be adjusted on a regular basis because stEVMOS accrues value against EVMOS daily. Therefore, it is important to keep the multisig simple and effective. \n\n- CO | Orbital Apes\n- 0xCtrlAltApe | Orbital Apes\n- Luisqa | Zenith Station\n- Silk Nodes\n- LPX | DAO\n- GV | DAO",

Valuable analytics such as a position’s PNL, ROI, impermanent loss, historical data, amount invested, etc., provides great insights that are easily understood by users.\n\nRevert has a solid track record, with successful collaborations with Uniswap deployments on other networks, such as [Polygon](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/_FfxBuW7iNwyJZuM796J3rHzRQ4wOYdAck3nWqqcoIE) and [Optimism](https:/mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/9GC9GWqygz-naejNxHueFZSH3RXCltqZ9BT_4LsWsWg). \n\nWe encourage everyone to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O61msPF5MYw) to learn more and get detailed insights on Revert’s tools. \n\n## Tools\n\n**Position Analytics:** Check and easily track the performance of your positions on Forge. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/position-analytics/uniswap-v3-positions).\n\n**Top positions:** The Top Positions section shows a list of the top active positions based on how they are performing overall on Evmos. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/top-positions).\n\n**Incentives:** Revert has an incentives section that displays the currently running incentives programs on the Uniswap v3 canonical staker contract, as well as the time-vested staker contract. Uniswap v3 position dashboards automatically detect and display the rewards accrued by each position. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/liquidity-incentives/time-vested-v3-staker).\n\n**Initiator:** The initiator helps users *initiate* LP positions. Opening positions on concentrated liquidity AMMs requires making important decisions about price ranges, which can be greatly aided with historical data and analysis. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/initiator/start-providing-liquidity).\n\n**Auto-compounding:** The Revert auto-compounder allows LPs to automate the compounding of the accrued fees in exchange for a fixed percentage of the compounded fees. This serves to incentivize a maximum number of compounds at optimal times with regards to gas costs. Info and screenshot [here](https://docs.revert.finance/revert/auto-compounder).\n\n**Position Management:** The position management interface is available from the account and position pages, where LPs can Add or Withdraw Liquidity and Claim Fees. Within this interface, you can also swap tokens to align with your desired ratio when adding liquidity, withdrawing, or claiming!\n\n## Milestones and Deliverables\n\nDeliverables refer to the tangible or intangible items that are completed by Revert Finance. These deliverables are grouped together into milestones. The team at Revert Finance has set a target of completing all the deliverables within ~8 weeks, with the goal of demonstrating a long-term commitment to the project. Milestone 1 is prioritized by Revert to help with the roll out of Forge incentives. The project start date is May 1st. \n\n**Milestone 1 - Incentive Tools [25% release 1 months after completion]**\n\n- Vested v3staker contract: Deployment of the vested v3 staker contract on EVMOS\n- Vested v3staker frontend: allowing anyone to stake positions and the creation of incentive programs for Forge pools.\n\n**Milestone 2 - Analytics and Indexing** **[25% release 2 months after completion]**\n\n- Analytics for existing positions: LPs are able to track PNL, APR, Fees etc for their positions\n- Indexing of top positions: Users are able to browse and explore the catalog of existing positions across Forge pools\n\n**Milestone 3- Position Management and Auto-compounder [25% release 3 months after completion]**\n\n- Initiator / backtester for Forge pools: Users are able to backtest and create new positions using the revert interface\n- v3utils contract and frontend: Utilities for LPs, swap and mint, move ranges, etc..\n- Auto-compounder: Deployment and support for the auto-compounder contract and protocol including auto-compounding bots\n\n**Milestone 4 - Keplr integration [25% release 4 months after completion]**\n\n- Integration of Keplr wallet\n\n## Revenue Module\n\nThe contracts that are deployed in Milestone 1 (vested v3staker contracts, i.e. pool incentives) will be registered on the [x/revenue module](https://docs.evmos.org/protocol/modules/revenue) with the Forge Community Multisig Safe as the `WithdrawerAddress`.\n\nThis will demonstrate Revert’s commitment and alignment with Forge’s core concept of being community owned, assist in the long-term goal of becoming a self-sustainable public good of Evmos, and shows good faith in Revert’s desire to grow alongside with the Evmos Community.\n\n## Funding Amount\n\nThe requested amount of 200,000 Evmos goes fully to the Revert Finance team if the milestones and deliverables are met. If the Revert Finance team fails to deliver within 4 months after the proposal passed, the remaining funds will be returned. \n\nSignatories (3/5 Threshold):\n\n- DAO | Benny\n- OA | CtrlAltApe\n- Rok | Qubelabs\n- Mario | Revert Finance\n- Bosco | Silk Nodes\n\nSafe Deployment Address: [0x3d7E191cABba892CEa2E00D06C67aF08dfd58CdD](https://safe.evmos.org/home?safe=evmos:0x3d7E191cABba892CEa2E00D06C67aF08dfd58CdD\u0026showCreationModal=true)",

        "description": "# Register NEOK Token as an IBC Coin\n\n## Author\n\nNEOKingdom DAO OÜ ([Estonian Business Registry](https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/16638166/Neokingdom-DAO-O%C3%9C), [GitHub](https://github.com/NeokingdomDAO), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Fb63MbqFFe), [Website](https://neokingdom.org/))\n\nThis proposal has been reviewed by lpx@EVMOS DAO.\n\n## Summary\n\nNeokingdom DAO is an innovative Estonian company committed to developing a comprehensive ecosystem for legally compliant DAOs. Our vision is to utilize EVMOS as the underlying blockchain technology to foster a new generation of companies, revolutionizing the way we collaborate and conduct business. By registering our NEOK token as an IBC coin, we aim to enhance liquidity and attract a diverse user base. In doing so, we strive to create value for the broader EVMOS community and contribute to the network's growth and success.\n\nOur project has a strong history with the EVMOS community, as Neokingdom DAO was awarded the second prize in the [second prize in the web3 track in 2022](https://devpost.com/software/teledisko-dao). Since then, we have kept building and refining our vision. And here we are today, excited to invite the EVMOS community to vote for our proposal.\n\n## Assets for RegisterCoin as ERC-20\n\nThe following asset is being requested for registration:\n\n- NEOKingdom DAO (NEOK) token: [0x655ecb57432cc1370f65e5dc2309588b71b473a9](https://escan.live/token/0x655ecb57432cc1370f65e5dc2309588b71b473a9).\n\n## Audit\n\nTo ensure the security and reliability of our smart contracts, NEOKingdom DAO has undergone a thorough audit process. Our contracts have been audited by SolidProof, a reputable smart contract auditing company. The audit report can be found [here](https://github.com/solidproof/projects/blob/e24f57897d081e5e0aeecf0a553a317533a9cb8f/2023/NeokingdomDAO/SmartContract_Audit_Solidproof_NeoKingdomDAO.pdf).\n\n## About NEOKingdom DAO\n\nNEOKingdom DAO, a [limited Estonian company](https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/16638166/Neokingdom-DAO-O%C3%9C), is dedicated to developing a comprehensive legal and technical framework for legally compliant DAOs in Europe. This initiative fosters a thriving ecosystem of interconnected businesses utilizing the DAO model, aiming to empower contributors by granting ownership and governance rights to those actively participating.\n\nThe NEOK token is central to this ecosystem, providing ownership, voting, and dividend rights within Neokingdom DAO and extending these rights to all associated DAOs.\n\nEmbracing technology-empowered organizations called DAOcracies, NEOKingdom DAO creates \"neokingdoms\"—DAOs wrapped into Estonian limited liability companies. By leveraging the EVMOS community's blockchain technology, the Framework is built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and tailored to individual neokingdoms. Users vote and interact with NEOkingdom DAO or neokingdoms through a custom-developed progressive web app.\n\nThe founders initially tested the Framework by transforming their company, teledisko GmbH, into the first neokingdom, refining it for wider application. Currently, two companies use the Framework—[teledisko DAO OÜ](https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/16374990/teledisko-DAO-O%C3%9C) and [NEOKingdom DAO OÜ](https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/16638166/Neokingdom-DAO-O%C3%9C)—with 3-5 more expected to join as neokingdoms in 2023.\n\nMore information about our tokenomics and technical implementation can be found in our [Technical Overview Document](https://github.com/NeokingdomDAO/contracts/blob/f121b78ff2f5eeb62b833c73d2ec91e2515c2147/docs/technical-overview.md).",

        "description": "# Inferno - An incentive program to bootstrap liquidity in Forge\n\n## Authors\n\n- Evmos DAO ([Telegram](https://t.me/evmosdao), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvmosDAO))\n- Orbital Apes ([Website](https://www.orbitalapes.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OrbitalApes))\n- Forge ([Telegram](http://t.me/forgedex),  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forgedex))\n\n## Summary\n\nIntroducing **Inferno** - a 12 week long incentive program to bootstrap liquidity in [Forge](https://app.forge.trade/#/swap), the community owned DEX of Evmos. The Forge team is requesting 3,000,000 Evmos to fund this initiative. The program aims to solve the liquidity issue on Evmos but also leverages the potential of concentrated liquidity and staked assets. Such a highly attractive incentive program combined with concentrated liquidity and LST has never been done in the Cosmos ecosystem before. Potentially making Forge the most capital efficient DEX within the Cosmos!\n\n## Goal\n\nCreate sustainable liquidity and volume on Forge but also raise awareness about DeFi on Cosmos with solidity-based applications. \n\n## Abstract\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe Evmos blockchain has the potential to become a unique environment for DeFi in the IBC ecosystem, but it has had its fair share of roadblocks that have slowed down and limited growth. By incentivizing staked assets (such as stEVMOS, stATOM, rETH) people will earn staking rewards while providing liquidity and participate in the incentive program; no DEX on Cosmos has done this yet which is a unique value proposition of Forge. On top of that highly concentrated pools can be created between the native and staked asset (such as stATOM/ATOM) with limited impermanent loss risks but lot of revenue potential.\n\n**Action plan and Pools** \n\nThe full incentive program has a duration of 84 days - divided into 4 periods of 21 days.  Before each period the incentive rewards will be liquid staked to stEVMOS and rolled into the 21 days program. As a result of liquid staking, the Stride DAO council committed to add 1,000 STRD/day to the incentive program. \n\nWe selected 7 pools in total and put them into three different incentive tiers. Our goal is to avoid fragmentation and get deep base liquidity on Evmos. The requested daily emissions equal to 7.9% of the current staking emissions. Users providing liquidity will potentially earn staking rewards, liquidity emissions from this program and LP fees. To find a rough estimate of the APR at $1M TVL per pool, please open the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133w6CmVNSxg78Zbtmd83VDrux244WXUsQbeqqO--PHY/edit?usp=sharing). Keep in mind that if the TVL is below $1M TVL, the APR is higher and vice versa.  \n\n**Tier 1 - ~9,286 EVMOS daily emission per pool**\n\n- stEVMOS/stATOM\n- stEVMOS/axlUSDC (+ 600 Stride incentives)\n- stEVMOS/axlRETH\n\n**Tier 2 - ~2,589 EVMOS daily emission per pool**\n\n- stEVMOS/STRD  (+ 200 Stride incentives)\n- stATOM/ATOM (+ 200 Stride incentives)\n\n**Tier 3 - ~1,339 EVMOS daily emissions per pool**\n\n- axlUSDC/ceUSDT\n- axlRETH/axlWETH\n\n**Vesting**\n\nThe time-vesting uniswap staker is a [fork of the Uniswap v3 staker](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/pUufXuRkUHjrV_oq0bq2sunvQ0hz7u529jWDKlQnm-Q) that adds a linear vesting period for positions to receive the full amounts of the accrued rewards. Linear vesing of rewards is intended to prevent ultra-concentrated liquidity from gaming the incentives and extract most of the rewards.  You can read more about it on this [post](https://mirror.xyz/revertfinance.eth/pUufXuRkUHjrV_oq0bq2sunvQ0hz7u529jWDKlQnm-Q).\n\nWhile the incentive rewards accrue proportional to *liquidity*, in the same way that trading fees do, the vested fraction increases linearly while the position is in range. Rewards that have not been accrued to positions not being staked or out of range or withdrawn before end of vesting period, would be rolled over to the next cycle.\n\n**Rewards claiming** \n\nVesting is calculated when you unstake the position. So, when you unstake the position, the contract checks if the liquidity was active for longer than the vesting period. If it is, you get all rewards for the amount of active liquidity you provided in the time period. if it's not it gives you the ratio of timespent/vesting period*(rewards received if there was no vesting period). \n\n**Timeline**\n\nIncentives can kick off once they're approved through governance and after Revert completes atleast the first two milestones of their funding proposal. We estimate the week of the 22nd May. \n\n**Adjustments**\n\nIf the liquidity of a pool does not match our expectation we might make adjustments on the allocation per pool as we learn during this program. Each change will be discussed on [Forge’s social channel](https://t.me/forgeDEX) and communicated upfront. \n\n## Multisig 4/6\n\nAll the funds will eventually flow to the liquidity providers.  \n\n- LPX | DAO\n- George | DAO\n- CtrlAltApe | OrbitalApes\n- John | Stride\n- Rok | Qubelabs\n- Luis | Interbloc\n\nSafe Deployment Address: [evmos:0xb75ce906a270F7680Faf1A2F6D70F4f28061B87a](https://safe.evmos.org/home?safe=evmos:0xb75ce906a270F7680Faf1A2F6D70F4f28061B87a\u0026showCreationModal=true)\n\n## Highlighting Engaged Community Members\n\nSpecial thanks for input \u0026 feedback on this program from Luis (Interbloc), _Nick (active community member) and John Galt (Stride).",

        "description": "## **Author:** \n\nAaron: [Telegram](https://t.me/Abrahalacite) , Discord: Aaron #3578\n\nSee the past updates and active discussion on the forum [here](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/11422-proposal-to-build-a-decentralized-derivatives-exchange-on-evmos).\n\n## **Project team member:**\n\n**Patrick:** [STEPN](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/stepn)'s senior full-stack developer. Rich experience in Dapp development for EVM-based Chain and Solana Chain. please learn more stepn information on link above from binance.\n\n**Linrz:** Wiredcraft, Lead Software Engineer.\n\n**Richard**: Amazon, Full Stack Engineer.\n\n**Shin:** Meta, Software Engineer.\n\n**Aaron:** View Exchange business \u0026 product. joined crypto space since 2019, been ambassidor for few layer 1 project. An EVMOS community member since launch, EVMOS Telegram unofficial Chinese channel Mod + EVMOS Wechat Group Creator.\n\n## **Summary:**\n\nIntroducing View Exchange - A decentralized derivatives exchange on EVMOS.\n\nWe believe EVMOS is the most powerful and efficient Layer 1 to provide users with a seamless trading experience. EVMOS's scalability, robustness, and compatibility with the EVM, make it an approprate soil for our Derivatives Exchange, ensuring fast and secure transactions. By leveraging EVMOS's advanced features, we aim to offer users a reliable and innovative trading platform that meets their needs while maximizing liquidity and minimizing costs.\n\nBy launching **FIRST Derivatives exchange** on EVMOS, View Exchange aims to attract more users and traders to the EVMOS ecosystem, which can result in greater liquidity and TVL. This can ultimately help create a more vibrant and robust DeFi ecosystem on EVMOS.\n\n# **The exchange will have below features:**\n\n- Decentralized Derivatives Exchange: traders can long/short an asset with Low Leverage initially to avoid high slippage, leverage will be set higher in the future when liquidity has met a certain threshold.\n- Simple experience: trade directly from your wallet.\n- Low fees: built on EVMOS with low gas fee.\n\n## **Benefits to the Ecosystem:**\n\n1. **Breaking Ecosystem barriers**: Remove the barriers that hinder derivative trading within the ecosystem, enabling more derivative traders to discover the Evmos and attract a greater number of traders.\n2. **Crypto on-ramp**: with on-ramp solution integration, we simplify the process of acquiring and onboarding new users by providing them with a seamless method to convert fiat currency into EVMOS ecosystem assets. This will enhance accessibility and attract a larger user base.\n3. **Greater Liquidity**: By launching a Derivatives exchange, we can attract a larger number of users and traders, which can result in greater liquidity. This will allow traders to execute larger orders without affecting the market price, resulting in a more efficient and reliable trading experience.\n4. **Token Buybacks**: the revenue generated from the protocol will be used to buy back the tokens from the market \u0026 burn, in order to maintain the market confidence.\n\n**If this proposal passed, the project development will be kick start immediately.**\n\n## **Project Follow up:**\n\n- A Project Progress Report will be released bi-weekly to the community.\n- Communication channels will be always open to answer all the questions.\n\n## **Tokenomics:**\n\n- Token Name: View Exchange Tokens (VE)\n- Max Supply: to be determined\n- Initial Supply: 10% ( 5% airdrop + 5% incentives = 10% inital circulating supply)\n\nDetails of the tokenomics will be introduced close to the mainnet launch.\n\n## **Allocation:**\n\n**Airdrop and Incentives:**\n\nTo express gratitude for the community's efforts, we have allocated 10% of View Exchange Tokens (VE) as follows:\n\n- Airdrop 5% of the tokens to EVMOS holders who have voted for this proposal.(yes, no, abstain)\n- Allocate 5% of the tokens as incentives for protocol users and social task engagement platforms such as Galxe, Zealy, Rabbithole, Layer 3, etc., aiming to attract more users to experience the EVMOS ecosystem.\n- We airdrop to those who voted for this proposal rather than the whole EVMOS addresses because we want to incentivize active participation in the EVMOS governance model. By limiting airdrop rewards to voters, we establish a mechanism where one's voice and opinion directly translate to clear benefits and rewards. This real incentive alignment optimizes for a governance system where the broadest range of EVMOS participants feel financially motivated to understand proposals, engage in debates, and ultimately vote to shape the protocol. Over multiple voting cycles, such an approach should yield increasingly representative outcomes as the community establishes a pattern of enthusiastic and knowledge-driven participation.\n- Any unclaimed airdrop tokens will be recycled back to the community treasury for future expenditure.\n\n**View Exchange Token (VE)**\n\n- 50% to the community (via liquidity mining, trading rewards, trading competition, staking and more).\n- 20% to community treasury.\n- 20% to the Core Contributors vested linearly over 3 years.\n\n**Note**: Above figures might be changed during implementation with community feedback.\n\n**Token Utility:**\n\n**Governance** **Voting**\n\nThe Protocol is governed and upgraded by VE holders and delegaters.\n\n**Protocol Earning**\n\n- 50% for Liquidity Providers in LP tokens\n- 30% dedicated to VE buyback and burn\n- 20% to the Core Contributors funds\n\nThe earnings to the Core Contributors funds will be exclusively used to cover the operation expenses. Every month, the unused amount will be reallocated towards Buyback and Burn.\n\n**Derivatives Fee Discount**\n\nVE holders get discount from 5% - 50% fees. (other fees still apply without discount to the opening positions).\n\n## **Milestone-Based Fund Release:**\n\nThe allocated fund are held in a multisig wallet, ONLY the initial 10% funding to kickstart the project is paid immediately after this proposal is passed; all other payments are made upon the completion of each milestone. If there are any unexpected event happend from Developement i.e: (unable to deliver proposed function, not meet the expectation.) Multisig will have the **FULL RIGHT** to send the remaining funds back to the community pool.\n\n**Kick Start - Immediately after this proposal has passed -  10%**\n\n- Release upon passing the proposal to kick start the development\n\n**Milestone 1 -  Local MVP - 10% - Time Frame: 1 - 1.5 month**\n\n- A Local MVP will be developed and released to the community for feedback collection.\n- Move to the next stage after improved based on community feedback.\n\n**Milestone 2- Deploy Derivative exchange on Testnet - 40% - Time Frame: 3 - 4 Month**\n\n- Deploy Derivatives on Testnet: during testnet phase, perpetual swaps function will roll out along with the development, for the community to test, give feedback, make improvements, until ready being on mainnet.\n- Seeking Audit: after ready to move from testnet to the mainnet, we will send all the source to get auditted. - invoice for Audit will be present to the community.\n- Marketing: started to build community, reach out all the social engagement platform, design a series tasks to attrack more users outside evmos ecosystem experiencing the exchange and evmos ecosystem dapps.\n\n**Milestone 3- Deploy Derivative exchange on Mainnet - 40% - Time Frame: 1 - 2 Month**\n\n- Deploy Derivatives on Mainnet: including all mentioned above.\n- Marketing: including all mentioned above.\n- Further Roadmap: will be decided by the community through on-chain governance.\n\n**Bonos Milestones: - Keplr integration + on ramp + 3rd party bridge - 0%**\n\n- Keplr integration: when keplr supports EVM we will integrate the wallet to the platform.\n- Add on-ramp solution (currently aim c14.money) to the platform.\n- Integrate one of the 3rd party bridge(celer/axlear/cypher) to the platform.\n\n## **Funding Amount:**\n\nThis funding proposal will kick off the development for View Exchange. The amount requested will be $150,000 (*1,250,000 EVMOS)  to fund the project development.\n\n- Should the value of EVMOS price decline, we commit to not seeking further funding in EVMOS to match the fiat value.\n\n**Fund Usage Breakdown:**\n\nWe expect this funding will give us 6 months to finish the development, be audited and deploy on the mainnet.\n\n which can be break down as below:\n\n- 60% - Exchange development (adding more people to the team, develop Perpetual, UI, Frontend, backend, smart contract, testing, infrustructure costs) \n- 13% - Marketing(campaines, community enagement, competition, ads, press release. etc.)\n- 20% - Audit - before launching on mainnet, we will get exchange audited by a reputatable audit company. Getting audited will be critical to gain trust from users, especially users outside of the Evmos Ecosystem.\n- 7% - Inital Liquidity to the exchange.\n- The Audit invoice will be presented to the Multisig members before they release funds. If actual Audit costs are less than the estimated amount, the multisig can return unused funds to the Community Pool.\n\n**Signatories (3/4 Threshold):**\n\n- Silent | Silent Validator\n- DEV_D | Community Mod\n- Luisqa | Interbloc Validator\n- Aaron | View Exchange\n\n**Safe Multisig Address**:\n\nEVM format: [evmos:0xfa60eAFb6d087cf8EDEa3142249E6E5876527582](https://safe.evmos.org/home?safe=evmos:0xfa60eAFb6d087cf8EDEa3142249E6E5876527582)\n\nEVMOS format: [evmos1lfsw47mdpp703m02x9pzf8nwtpm9yavzl58kfe](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos/account/evmos1lfsw47mdpp703m02x9pzf8nwtpm9yavzl58kfe)\n\n**Risk / Risk Mitigation Risk:** The funds are held in a multisig and are paid out on completion of each milestone, except for the first 10% being paid initially to kick start the project.",

For more information on the types of upgrades, please visit our [Software Upgrade Guide](https://docs.evmos.org/validate/upgrades).\\n\\n## Impact\\n\\nEvmos v13.0.2 (Apeiron) contains the following changes and enhancements:\\n\\n- Introduce EVM extensions for staking, distribution and IBC transfers\\n- Upgrade CometBFT to [v0.34.29](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.34.29) and Cosmos SDK to [v0.46.11](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.11)\\n- Many small improvements and refactors\\n\\nA full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/releases/v13.0.2).\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nThe Evmos core team created an End-to-End testing suite that performs the software upgrade locally. These tests have been completed successfully for this upgrade. The instructions on how to run the End-to-End testing suite can be found [here](https://github.com/evmos/evmos/blob/main/tests/e2e/README.md). Additionally, the upgrade has been manually performed on a local node.\\nOn top of the upgrade tests, the Evmos team runs performance tests to monitor the impact of new versions.\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nPlease follow and discuss this proposal using the official [discussion on Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/12023-evmos-mainnet-v1302-upgrade).",
